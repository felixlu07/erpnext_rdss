<strong>What happened on Sunday 17/01/21</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>swollen neck</li>
 	<li>Swollen foot</li>
 	<li>swollen throat</li>
</ul>
I acted quite fast. I texted my husband and told him that my throat was swelling. He knows the drill. Anything that attacks the face, throat, or abdomen is an emergency. It has happened before.Upon arrival at the hospital, I was really hungry, knowing that my throat was swelling and because my pain threshold is very high, I could still have brunch, but I only had soft tofu and soup. Lucky I ate something because once I was at A&amp;E, I wouldn't be allowed to eat or drink.<a href=""http://rdss.org.sg/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Jannah-swollen-face-and-lips.jpg""><img class="" wp-image-2715 alignright"" src=""http://rdss.org.sg/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Jannah-swollen-face-and-lips-300x300.jpg"" alt="""" width=""163"" height=""163"" /></a>

It was very fast. I was given priority, and I prompted the nurses that I'm having an HAE attack in my throat. Giving me the priority is their standard operating procedure. Everything happened so fast; they took my blood, put an IV plug in me, then I was wheeled to RESUS. In there, I am already strapped with wires, and they scope my throat. Given I am eight weeks pregnant makes this whole situation much more complicated as the doctor needs to figure what to give me or not. A few minutes after the scope, they administered a particular medicine - I can remember exactly what it was, but it was something like hydrocortisone. Soon after, my throat felt so tight it feels like something is pushing me against the wall, and I can't breathe. Plus, I have sore throat pain.
<p style=""text-align: left;"">I was already half awake and groggy. A doctor from the high dependency ward came down to see me and told me they would bring me up to the ward soon and that they are going to put me on close monitoring. Before bringing me up to the ward, they went over the risks of the medicine my doctor suggested they give me, which was C1 Inh Esterase. This treatment is expensive in Singapore - but this is the 'mother of all' emergency medicines for HAE and the only treatment available in hospitals for severe attacks in Singapore. I fully understand what is about to happen, but I'm not worried about this medicine's price at this time.  C1 Inh Esterase is just another rare disease medicine that no one can afford in Singapore. I am only worried about the human growing inside me and myself. I just nodded and said 'yes' after hearing the risk and the medical jargon the doctor explained.  I just nodded again and replied, ""I understand.""</p>
Because of my pregnancy, I am unable to take the only available preventative treatment in Singapore.  This treatment is an androgen and has many unpleasant side effects, but I use it because I know how expensive the acute treatment is and that it is not always available to everyone.

In the ward, they took my weight for the medicine. I need three boxes of C1 Inh Esterase as the treatment is based on my weight.  Once they administered the medication, the swelling doesn't go away immediately, and it still takes few hours. But I felt the difference by the hour.

I thank the medical team, the doctors for keeping me sane. They didn't tell me that my airway was already close 60% - they told my husband. I think if the doctors had said this to me, I would have panicked and cried. I thanked them for my life. I'm thankful that I acted quite fast and went immediately to the hospital, knowing the attack was getting worse.  If I am still my old self in denial, I guess I would only go to the hospital at the very last minute, but by then, I don't know if I'm going to make it alive or not. I'm really very thankful and blessed for the people around me. <a href=""http://rdss.org.sg/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Jannah-swollen-face.jpg""><img class=""size-medium wp-image-2716 alignleft"" src=""http://rdss.org.sg/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Jannah-swollen-face-290x300.jpg"" alt="""" width=""290"" height=""300"" /></a>

I feel that my story needs to be heard in Singapore and all over the world. Anyone who is just like me, or afraid, you are not alone. We can relate to you. I'm thankful to have come across HAE International and know Fiona Wardman (patient, HAEi Regional Patient Advocate for Asia Pacific), and be part of the HAEi community and the patient lead for my own country Singapore with the help of Fiona. My wish and aims are that patients in Singapore with HAE will accept and have access to modern treatments.

Jaslynn is 7 this year, attending SPED school at AWWA. Her diagnosis is Pitt Hopkins Syndrome which is associated with GDD, Hypotonia and Microcephaly. She has a lesion of alphasia cuts on her scalp since birth. Although she had a few seizures episodes, she was not put on any medication to further prevent any seizures from happening.

Being non verbal, Jaslynn is only able to reject by shaking her head or to wave her hand. She is a happy girl who likes music and movement. Jaslynn is  very fortunate to have an adult sister, who always sings and dances for her.  It takes a lot of guess work for us though to know why she throws a tantrum. Most of the time we would be left wondering why she is upset.

For her mobility, she uses a Kaye Walker to walk which also helps her to strengthen her core muscles. Most of the time she is scooting across the floor using her butt.

Jaslynn takes solid food and formula milk as her main staple. Due to her weak muscles, her food is cut into small pieces for her to chew more easily. We also do daily chewing therapy to help her strengthen her chewing strength.

Jaslynn also has high astigmatism. She starting wearing a pair of spectacles at a young age of 2. She also went through a minor day surgery operation for her left ear hearing loss due to Otitis Media with effusion(OME). Otherwise her condition is very stable and only needs regular check every 6 months.

It maybe a tough journey for her but she has us to be with her ❤!

<em><strong>Our journey</strong></em>

Being a parent/caregiver for a special needs child is never easy as we need to keep our eyes on her 24/7.  We only discovered about her condition when she was not hitting her milestones at one year old.  After seeking advice from KKH, we were devastated to know that she has GDD and Hypotonia  and that her head is actually smaller than other kids. To best help Jaslynn, we enrolled her for EIC when she was two. We also placed her in a infant day care center while I, as the mom, continued to work part time. Due to the center's closure and also her slow development in her fine and gross motor skills, we could not find any center that was willing to accept her when she was four years old and older.

We decided to take care of her on our own as we also had no faith in getting a helper to care for her needs. Both husband and I have since left the work force. My husband is a Grab Driver which gives him more time flexibility.  It was a very stressful transition, for myself being a full time caregiver and also having to manage the high household expenses at the same time , depending on my husband as the sole breadwinner. I kept asking myself why my child was so different and blamed myself for not taking good care of my health during pregnancy.
<p style=""text-align: left;"">Fortunately with the moral support of my family and friends, I gradually opened up. I have also become more patient. To be able to see her slowly improving and achieving every small milestones, I really have no regrets becoming a full time caregiver.</p>
After knowing her diagnosis in year 2020 from the genetic tests, I started to find out more about her condition online and that is how I found out about RDSS. I felt inspired by the patient stories whereby most of them are on high support and are more challenging to take care compared to the needs of my child. I believed they too went through a lot of sacrifices, and shower their child with lots of unconditional love.  In the support group chat,  we would always receive warm greetings and advices from one another.
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Thank you RDSS for giving the support and encouragement that we need! </strong></p>
From my experience and what I saw in other parents, I have learnt not to give up on our loved ones even though they are special. Perseverance and tolerance is what we need the most during our caregiving journey. To see them grow up and their smiles, it simply make our day.

Nicolas is 12 years old this year! He was diagnosed with Angelman Syndrome with Epilepsy and Cyclic Vomiting Syndrome.

It causes delay in his  development. Nicolas is not able to communicate verbally, has problems with sleeping and balancing his body. Due to his underlying condition, Nicolas also has intellectual disability.

However, Nicolas is a happy boy! He smiles and laughs frequently!  He has this happy and excitable personality in him!

As a full time caregiver and mother to Nicolas , all of my time and energy is spent on him. We also use part of my savings to pay for his long term medications, hospitalization and physiotherapy fees. Most of the time, caregiving for Nicolas makes me feel a heavy responsibility, and sometimes stressful.  However, all these goes away when I saw his happy face and when we see improvement in his development. I would feel extremely happy and encouraged.

I would like to take this chance to thank RDSS for the schemes that allow me to claim for some reimbursement. This allows our family to defray some cost for Nicolas therapy needs. We are also extremely grateful for the sponsors and donors for helping to fund the Home Based Learning and Therapy Support, it really helps us a lot in improving the quality of life for Nicolas. We also appreciate the events that are organized for the beneficiaries and their families so that we have the opportunity to meet up with other parents, and to share our experiences and joy with caregiving of our child who has a rare disorder.
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Because of the fellow support I found in RDSS, I do not feel alone and hopeless. </strong></p>
I hope that other families who are in this similar journey, to also stand positive and remain strong. Remember, you are not alone. We also do hope one day, the public can be more tolerant and considerate towards a person with special needs.

I believe Love Is Not Rare!

Nicolas, Daddy and Mummy loves you! ❤️

<em><strong>Who is Rachael?</strong></em>

Rachael was born with a chromosome disorder that was not detected during pregnancy, so it was a terrible shock for us when we knew she was sick upon her birth. In fact, it was so complicated, there was no syndrome name, it was just a string of karyotypes. When she was born via an emergency c-section, Rachael needed help with her breathing due to her heart conditions so she was sent to NICU immediately. When I could finally get out of bed to visit her the next day, she looked so frail in her cot, far from the healthy, bouncy baby we had expected. Oxygen was pumped into this box covering her head. A tube was placed in her mouth to bring milk straight to her stomach. Wires were stuck onto her little body to monitor her heartbeat, oxygen level and respiration. The doctors said she would need several operations from what they could see. Just how many, they weren’t sure. More tests would be needed to determine the nature and extent of her condition.
Rachael was first suspected to have Trisomy-13, due to her club feet, low set ears, heart problems and central cleft palate. The only information we had then was that Trisomy-13 usually results in stillborns, or they usually survive only 2 weeks to 2 months. When the test results came back, we had our diagnosis, but no prognosis. As Rachael struggled to breathe and cling onto life, we held our breath each time we looked at her tiny body, going through so much pain and discomfort. How we wished we could take her place or do something, anything at all, to reduce her pain.

<em><strong>Her journey</strong></em>
Rachael was, and still is, very strong-willed. As she had Fallots Tetralogy (a set of 4 problems in her heart), the doctors were worried about her oxygen saturation and decided to give her oxygen via nose tubes. But my dear girl would have nothing of that sort. When they finally found the tiniest tube to fit her nose, she wailed out so loudly, you could hardly believe she had severe cardio problems. She went on to cry for another 4 hours, until I finally gave up, took off the tubes, and told the doctors I would be responsible should anything happen. To everyone’s amazement, she fell into a deep slumber (probably too tired from all that crying), and maintained her saturations at 85% and above, on room air, which was eventually accepted as her baseline. She hasn’t needed any oxygen since then.

As Rachael approached her 3rd week in the hospital, we requested for home leave to celebrate her first month. To our pleasant surprise, we were told she could be discharged! I could not believe that just 3 days before, the doctors cancelled a life-saving operation on her, and now we could go home! Yay! But the happiness was very short-lived. There were so many things we had to learn and prepare before we could convince the doctors that we could care for her at home, and it hit us hard then that it will be a rocky road.

From then, Rachael was in and out of the hospital for different reasons and her operations got more and more dramatic. 45-min operation would extend into 3 hours. 3-hour operation extended into 6 hours! Something unexpected would happen every time. Most of the doctors already classified her as the “top tricky patient” in their discipline! At her “peak”, Rachael was seeing 11 doctors and 3 therapists and the schedule was killing me. I could no longer handle working full-time and caring for her, so I had to quit my job to take care of her myself together with a helper.

When Rachael celebrated her first birthday, we threw a little party for family and close friends, and it was a very touching moment for everyone. Although she is a special child, she is very well-loved by our families and friends, and everyone was happy to see her come so far.

<em><strong>How did we keep going?</strong></em>
After going through no less than 15 operations (a couple of major, mostly minor),

<img class="" wp-image-2448 alignright"" src=""http://rdss.org.sg/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Rach-Family-298x300.jpeg"" alt="""" width=""235"" height=""237"" />she was warded in the hospital less and less frequently, and I was able to discharge many doctors out of the initial 11 we were seeing. I never thought that I would ever be able to care for a sick person, let alone my own child, but I think I have proven many people, especially myself, wrong when I could manage her scary operation wounds (the stoma still gives me nightmares), her tantrums, her feedings, the hours of waiting outside the operating theatre, the many nights caring for her at the hospital, sleeping on cold hard chairs, and even quitting my job to care for her myself, while daddy went overseas for work. I have done many things beyond what I could ever imagine I was capable of. I even earned myself a “reputation” for telling irresponsible doctors off for not doing their jobs properly! But for the dedicated doctors, I thank them with deep gratitude, for they not only heal my child, but they also heal me too. The doctors knew that Daddy was working overseas most of the time, and always asked if I was coping well. And I know I could do all these because I had the strong support, help and love from our families and dear friends, and also the team at KK hospital. I could not have done it alone.

It was a huge struggle when we decided to send her for her long-overdue open heart surgery when she was five years old. The surgery was another drama, as usual. Our surgery date was postponed three times, and once when we were already on our way to the hospital! The operation also took twice as long as they expected as they discovered another problem just as they finished fixing her original problems. We waited outside the OT for eight long hours that felt like an eternity! Her recovery was very slow, so she stayed in the ICU for 10 days, instead of the expected five days. When we finally left ICU, it was as if she knew she was on the road to recovery and she bounced back in double-quick time, and we were out of the hospital soon. She recovered fully from her operation and was back to her normal playful self, and seemed happier now that she is breathing better. As if to comfort us that we’ve made the right decision for such a risky operation, she started chuckling for the first time in 5 years.

Rachael is now in a stable condition, happily attending her special school twice a week (pre-COVID), and we are just happy to stay away from the hospital as much as possible. Our favourite phrase when we see familiar nurses during our appointments is “Hey, long time no see!”. Those were the dark days when we just had to take a day, an hour at a time. Sometimes we wished something would take her away and she would stop suffering. But when we see her angelic face and her charming smile, we know that our lives would be so empty without her.

Rachael will be turning 16 years old in October 2020, and every year, we host a little party for her to celebrate her victory. <strong>She’s inspired many caregivers and parents with special needs children, our friends and even strangers, with her strong will to live and her happy nature despite her handicaps.</strong> As parents, inspired by her, we also started organising community projects, leading others to give back to the special needs community in many ways.

We’ve stopped asking ourselves those questions for which there are no answers. We just feel blessed each day that our Little Angel is still with us. <em>Love is not Rare!</em>

Grace was born on 21 November 2008 prematurely at 34 weeks old. She was diagnosed with a genetic condition known as Pyruvate Dehydrogenase Complex Deficiency. Because of this condition, her brain was not fully developed and she has Partial Agensis of the Corpus Callosum (PACC).

<em><strong>Her journey</strong></em>

She had low muscle tone resulting in silent aspirations. So the initial few years was focused on early intervention therapies including safe feeding, gross motor skills, baby massages to relieve her gastro issues due to low tone. Grace is on strict Ketogenic Diet as the only lifelong “treatment” to counter the lack of energy and cell production from carbohydrates. Aside from that, she is on various therapies to continue to help her overcome global developmental delays.

Grace is turning 12 soon. She obviously outgrows her walking aids and pushchairs through her growing years.

Till date, Grace’s capability remains at a neuro age of under a 2-year-old, learning to walk independently, unable to verbalise. She is currently attending school at Rainbow Centre Margaret Drive School.

As working parents, the family is highly dependent on a good caregiver to take care of Grace. The family views respite care as essential for any caregiver or parents to be able to sustain long term care for Grace.

Grace is on strict Ketogenic Diet for life. Her milk powder Ketocal is 80% fat in powder form is considered a medical diet supplement. There is only one manufacturer in the world. It is expensive milk powder and Grace consumes one tin in 5 days.

Grace does not have silent aspirations any more. She is stronger in muscle tone now but still unable to walk independently. At the same time, she is growing quickly. So we have to keep changing her AFOs/Push chair/Seats. Fortunately, we are blessed with a walker from a donor that was arranged through RDSS. And this walker can last her for at least 2 more years.
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>RDSS has provided huge support platform, especially emotional support with families facing some stress and caregiving issues, therapy needs.</strong></p>
We receive reimbursements to help defray expenses although the amount is negligible as compared to the expenses.

The get-together sessions organised are valuable as the family finds it stressful to travel out on our own. When we have volunteers and the medical team with us, as wel as support from other families, we can then truly relax and enjoy.

The opportunity of participating in Voices of Rare at the annual Purple Parade, among many other outreach programs is important for the family to create awareness and promote inclusivity of patients with rare diseases.

Many people do not know how to react, express their care when they see any special needs child. We need to continue to share our stories and vocalise our expectations so that people become more comfortable.

For us, Grace is like any other babies, need to be coaxed and entertained. So just make her laugh like what you would do to another baby.

<em><strong>Who is Chloe?</strong></em>

Chloe was born in November 2009 and was diagnosed with Pompe Disease at 7 months old. Despite the many uncertainties and fears faced initially, Chloe showed exceptional courage to fight the disorder, overcoming death several times. She became the first baby to be diagnosed in Singapore with Pompe disease and to undergo the Enzyme Replacement Therapy (ERT) for the treatment. Every week, Chloe undergoes ERT at KK Hospital, for which the treatment cost per year amounts to an approximate of $500,000.

<em><strong>Her journey</strong></em>

In 2012, Chloe underwent PEG surgery and she now has a feeding button to help her with her food intake. In 2015, Chloe met another milestone when the cardiologist removed her medication for her heart as she had no risk of heart failure anymore. Chloe has to attend various therapies from OT, PT and SLT. Recently, she has also started having Educational and Art therapy from home while she continues to receive education from Rainbow Centre.

Chloe went under the knife again for tracheostomy in October 2019. This was done to better support and manage her respiratory issues. She continues to do well in health and has started to develop her interest in music in recent times.

<em><strong>How did we keep going?</strong></em>

RDSS pitched her story to the media <a href=""http://rdss.org.sg/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2020-02-29-11.41.06-scaled.jpg""><img class=""wp-image-2429 alignleft"" src=""http://rdss.org.sg/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2020-02-29-11.41.06-225x300.jpg"" alt="""" width=""167"" height=""223"" /></a>and she was subsequently featured in various media such as Strait Times, The New Paper, Lianhe Zaobao, Wanbao, The Online Citizen, Mediacorp Channel 5, Channel 8 and Motherhood magazine.

Her sharing has helped to raise awareness of rare disorders in Singapore and even brought many families, who are in walking in the same journey, together. The Society is assisting her, under the ""Power for Life"", ""Home-based Learning Scheme"" and ""Medical Intervention Scheme"" program.

We want and have this to say:
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Every child, regardless of their different needs, has the rights to live and be given the fair opportunity to grow and develop their abilities. We are here to love and offer them the quality of life.</strong></p>

<h5 style=""text-align: right;"">                                  <em><strong>- Kenneth Mah,  father of Chloe </strong></em></h5>
Chloe's living needs add up to almost $3,500 a month and the Society hopes to raise more funds to assisting the family to lessen their financial burden. You can pledge your support for Chloe by contributing directly to her CDA (Child Development Account).

<p style=""text-align: left;""><strong><em>Who is En Ning?</em></strong>
Kang En Ning, who is now 8 1/2 years old, was diagnosed with Antley Bixler Syndrome. This rare disorder causes malformations of the head and face, as well as other skeletal abnormalities. She now attends a mainstream school that supports children with hearing loss.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><em><strong>Her journey</strong></em>
In her 1st 2 years of life, the hospital was her 1st home. She was frequently hospitalised for sickness, if not admitted for surgeries. She went under the knives literally from the head to her toes. The major surgeries that she had gone through, were tracheostomy to secure her airway, one for the heart, cyst removal, a rectum reconstruction, cleft palate correction and clubfoot correction. For feeding, a PEG button is inserted for the feed to enter directly into her stomach. The anxiety that En Ning's mother faced, with each time that her daughter was in the operation theatre, was not something that any parent would want to go through.</p>
The duration of each hospital stay usually ranged from a few weeks to a few months. This had drained both mummy and daddy emotionally, physically, mentally and financially. Fortunately, as En Ning gets older, she has also grown physically stronger and the trips to the hospital became less often.

A new chapter in her life opens as she starts going to mainstream school. It is both exciting and worrying for her parents. Being in school means that she will be able to learn how to socialise with other children. However, her parents also worry that she may not be able to cope with regular school work. They are also concerned if she will get laughed at because of her physical appearance and being a target of bullying.

<em><strong>How did we keep going?
</strong></em>Despite her busy school schedule, En Ning still attends therapy sessions such as speech, OT, audio, listening and feeding. <strong>
</strong>

Who is Hazel?</strong></em>
My girl, Hazel Tan is 9 years old this year. She was diagnosed with Shaken Baby Syndrome at 3months old, followed by West Syndrome. We have tried many types of medications on her, and by far, only Prednisolone was able to control her seizures. However, once we start to wean her off, the spasms would come back. Stopping the spams with medication is not an ideal solution as it is not suitable to be consumed for the long term. Until now, she still has spasms daily. Hazel is attending school at CPAS, and has been enjoying her time in school. She is able to walk independently for a short distance, but for most of the time, she loves to be carried.

<em><strong>Her journey</strong></em>
Even though Hazel does not communicate verbally with us, she will show us her emotions in other ways. She laughs loudly when she is happy, she screams and gets angry if we do not do things her way. Sometimes she mimicked our words and that really tickled us! Our biggest challenge would be when she is unwell, as she would totally stop taking in water and milk. This would escalate further her spasms when she does not have sufficient fluid intake.

<em><strong>What keeps us going?</strong></em>
RDSS is a big family, made up of many parents who have many more years ahead of me, of handling a special child. When Hazel was diagnosed back in 2012, I thought I was the only one facing it and my world was so dark. I kept to myself, struggled between emotions and having to care for a special needs child. I could not accept it. I was even more emotional after seeing friends around me with their neurotypical children. That made things more difficult for me. I often thought to myself, ""Why me? Why does it have to Hazel?""

After getting to know more parents in RDSS and opening up to them, I woke up to a whole new world. I envy normal children, but many parents also envy Hazel because the least is, she can move, she can cry, she can laugh, she can stand, she can hold a toy in her hands. These actions which seem like a normal and easy feat was no easy job for our special child. They gotta work doubly or triply harder to achieve it. There are children with a rare disorder, whose condition may not as good. These parents taught and showed me that, even our journey may be tough, but we learn to walk with faith and hope. Our child needs us. How will the child feels if their own parents keep feeling negative and dwell in sadness? I certainly want to bring more joy and happiness to Hazel's life!
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>It is a very joyful and warm community in RDSS, with us cheering each other on, praying for children who were hospitalized, giving suggestions and recommendations on suitable therapies. I am glad that I got to know RDSS and also proud to be part of this community. I do not feel so lonely anymore while walking this journey.</strong></p>
It is never easy to hear our child being ""diagnosed"". We may never be able to come to terms with it because we hoped that one day our child will be normal. What I have learnt in these 9 years with Hazel is, life is unpredictable and I want to treasure every day that I have with her.

She achieved her little milestones from time to time, in her own ways, at her own pace. I tried not to brood over what she cannot but celebrates on what she can. As the saying goes, happy mummy, happy child!

<em><strong>Who is Zecia Chew?</strong></em>
Zecia is a 12 years old girl, diagnosed with Gaucher’s disease at the age of 3 years old. This disease will cause fats to accumulate in her body which causes severe stomach bloating and will be fatal if she does not receive treatment. She has to be admitted to the hospital every 2 weeks for her infusion. This life-saving enzyme replacement therapy is needed for her to be able to continue to live, like a normal child.

<em><strong>Her journey living with rare</strong></em>
Zecia is a regular in KKH and has been receiving her infusion for the past 9 years. For the treatment, she has to be pricked and the IV plug set on her hand. Instead of being afraid of the needle, Zecia can even help the nurses to choose her vein to set the plug! Although she looks comfortable even as she rests on the hospital bed, with the needle on her hand, as parents, we feel the aching pain in our hearts.

This journey of the past 9 years has not been easy. However, Zecia is a very brave and jovial girl and it just warms our heart seeing her still being so positive. As her parents, we knew we need to stay even stronger, to give her more support. We are and always be here for our most courageous girl, to be the pillars of her life.

<em><strong>How RDSS helps?</strong></em>
When we first knew that Zecia is diagnosed with Gaucher’s disease, we were shocked and lost for words. We have absolutely no idea even how to react. Knowing that our girl is sick with a disease so rare, how can we help her?
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>We are glad that RDSS appeared in our lives. We get to know other parents whom their child also has a rare condition. They comforted us, gave us support, shared information and showed us that we are not alone in this journey. They gave us light in those dark times! We are deeply thankful to RDSS for always being there with us.</strong></p>
Every child is unique. They are special. They are a gift from the god. They are precious and deserve to be loved.<strong> Stay positive and strong.</strong>

Always remember, <em>Love is not Rare</em>.

<em><strong>Who is Jarren?</strong></em>
Jarren is diagnosed with Congenital Hypomyelination Neuropathy (CHN). Since young, he was frequently admitted into ICU and each stay would last months. Jarren was tube-fed via NGT until he was 2 years old, where he underwent an operation to insert a PEG feeding button into his stomach. He also underwent a tracheostomy procedure later that same year. Due to the severity of his condition, Jarren relies on a ventilator for respiratory support. Many rare genetic disorders, including his condition, have no treatment or cure.

<em><strong>His journey</strong></em>
In the blink of an eye, it seemed just like yesterday, when we knew Jarren's condition. The little boy whom we last read about on RDSS website, is now 10 years old and a Primary 4 child. The journey to where he is now is also full of challenges.  Let us recap his journey along the way.

There were many challenges and difficulties faced during this journey.

He is currently in a normal mainstream primary - Northoaks Primary School. He still needs assistance in school from the caregiver such as bringing out his text books and toileting. He also needs more attention in class and extra tuition was given to help to do better academically.

<a href=""http://rdss.org.sg/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Jarren-Skinny-Pic-rotated.jpg""><img class="" wp-image-2453 alignleft"" src=""http://rdss.org.sg/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Jarren-Skinny-Pic-225x300.jpg"" alt="""" width=""145"" height=""193"" /></a>Jarren needs to undergo sleep study test every year to monitor on his sleeping issues, especially at night time. The close monitoring is very much needed because we do not want him to have another episode of drastic weight loss.  He does his yearly MLB to ensure that his airway is clear.  Even after trying various milk formula, and even to test out if there are any nutritional deficiencies, Jarren continues to thrive better when he is being given the special formula. With dietician's prescription, we have to give supplement him with the extra milk to nourish his body and to maintain his weight.
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Being active members of RDSS, we are thankful for receiving support from society over the years. </strong></p>
Our family receives reimbursements under the Power for Life Program and also from Medical Intervention Support Scheme (MIS). This helps us to ease some of our financial burden.

<strong><em>Who is Janelle?</em></strong>
Hi my name is Joanne and my daughter is Janelle who is 11 years old. She was diagnosed with Quadriplegic Cerebral Palsy, Dystonia and Global Development Delay at age of 1 year plus old. Currently, she is schooling at Rainbow Centre Margaret Drive.

<em><strong>Her journey</strong></em>
It took us a while to accept her diagnosis because everything seemed well when she was eating and sitting normally at few months old. Taking care of her was hard and difficult in the beginning because both my husband and I had to work to support the family. We took turns to bring her to the hospital for her therapies and check-up and soon our family grew as I was pregnant with my second child, and a few years later, with my third child.

<em><strong>How did we keep going?</strong></em>
We knew we had to do whatever it takes to help her unleash her potential as she is our child. We also want her to be always so happy. Luck is on my side as I have a good helper who takes very good care of Janelle. She helps in bathing and dressing her up, feeding her, bringing her to the school. She is also very independent as she is able to bring Janelle for therapies when I am busy at work.

I was introduced to RDSS years back. Through the society, I got to know many other super mummies whom their child also has special needs. They are all doing very well taking care of their child and family.
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>We share our own journey and experiences and have a lot of fun during the gatherings. RDSS provides some financial subsidy that helps lessen our financial burden.</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">I want to convey this message to all special need child parents that you are not alone. Our child is a gift from God. We have to unwrap this gift that we are blessed with. Your journey maybe not the same as others, but we just have to journey along, and <strong>treasure every moment that we have with our special one</strong>.💞 We will never know when we will leave each other.

<em><strong>Who is Sarah?</strong></em>

Swee Sarah, a feisty trachy warrior! Sarah is already 8 years old and she definitely has come a long way! Born at week 38 via elective Csect, Sarah was born with stridor and not able to swallow. She has facial palsy on the left side of her face, is non-verbal, and non-mobile.

<em><strong>Her journey</strong></em>

She has gone under knives to have two extra holes opened on her. One that helps secure her airway, and the other for her feeding. Even though we have been through the full exome sequencing, science still cannot explain to us at this point in time, why Sarah is so unique and special in her own ways.

Even so, Sarah has shown and proven to us yet again, every human is the same on earth, despite how unique and special we are. We can feel and understand in our own ways. The difference is how we express ourselves.

<em><strong>How did we keep going?</strong></em>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Our humble family of four is <strong>thankful</strong> to have met other families from RDSS who are also journeying in this vast sea of special parenthood. We know that we are never alone in this journey with the strong bond and love from the community.</p>
<strong>Show empathy and not sympathy</strong>, because we are just as ordinary. Having a special child doesn't make us extraordinary special. <em>Love is not Rare.</em>

<em><strong>Who is Xin Ying?</strong></em>

Our lovely daughter Xing Ying turns 12 this year. She was diagnosed with a rare neurological disorder known as Pachygyria. This condition hampers her development since birth. She has speech and mobility issues. At this age, Xing Ying uses a special buggy to move her around. When she needs help, she will show in her body language, letting us know that she may not be comfortable. And she can only consume orally softer textured food and milk prescribed by the nutritionist.
<div id=""imu"">

<em><strong>Our journey</strong></em>

As her parents and caregivers, we have learnt to accept her condition since birth. We un<a href=""http://rdss.org.sg/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/WhatsApp-Image-2020-09-22-at-6.01.40-AM.jpeg""><img class="" wp-image-2423 alignleft"" src=""http://rdss.org.sg/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/WhatsApp-Image-2020-09-22-at-6.01.40-AM-225x300.jpeg"" alt="""" width=""181"" height=""242"" /></a>derstand her needs and wants and helped Xing Ying to unleash her potential as a child. The goals that we set for her are as simple as having a pair of strong and healthy lungs so that we can stay by her side longer.

&nbsp;

<strong>Xing Ying is simply special!</strong> For the past 12years, she has taught and guided us, in her own ways, on how we can help her manage physically and mentally. She is a fighter and a role model for her brothers and sister. Xing Ying has three younger siblings age 10, 9 and 5. They have journeyed together with Xing Ying and have been giving their love to her all this while!

<em><strong>How did we keep going?</strong></em>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>RDSS plays a critical role in parenting our special needs and their siblings.</strong></p>
We get to know other parents through the parents networking sessions. The siblings of the beneficiary get to bond together through events that are specially planned and executed by the older siblings. Through the gatherings, the beneficiaries also get to participate in activities together with their family. This journey is never walked alone.

Children with special needs are amazing! They are only normal children with simply different needs and they too, are role models to their love ones. We are immensely proud of our beloved Xing Ying!

Remember, <em>Love is Not Rare</em>!

<p style=""text-align: left;"">Hi My name is Frederick Seah, and my wife is Rebekah. My elder daughter is Beth and the younger one, Danielle.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><strong><em>Who is Danielle?</em>
</strong>Danielle has been suffering from a medical condition called SMA - spinal muscular atrophy. Her muscles are unable to develop even as she grows older. This resulted in severe immobility which affects her respiratory and digestive system. Unable to move, to breathe and to feed herself, she needs the help of a machine and from her caregivers. At present, there is no cure for her.</p>
<strong><em>Her journey</em>
</strong>It has been a twelve-year long journey, and we know that for these years, it has been a miracle for Danielle and for us. Twelve years ago, we were told by the doctor that she could, at most, live to 2 years old. However, the goodness of the Lord allowed her to survive on these extra years.

SMA affects her ability to be mobile. This paralysis requires 24 hours of constant care. From wiping off her tears (Yes! She cries because like all of us, she feels and gets emotional!), to constantly having to turn her body from side to side, Danielle requires 24/7 constant care. Danielle needs her daily physiotherapy to prevent contraction of muscles and body tissues on her limbs.

Every 4-5 hourly, we also need to suction the secretions in her mouth as she is unable to swallow. This is to ensure she does not get choked on her own saliva. She uses a milk pump to slowly pump liquid food through a feeding tube and directly into her stomach.

We have also engaged a special teacher to be by her bedside, to keep her mind active, stimulating her cognitive growth.

<strong><em>How did we keep going?</em>
</strong>Friends, Danielle’s every moment in her fragile life, is in His hands.
It is laborious and tedious to take care of her, yet for us, <strong>she is a gift from God</strong>. <strong>We do not fully understand why all these happen but we know there is a purpose.</strong> We take a step at a time. We rely totally on God’s strength and His wisdom.

I thank God for His faithfulness, for His grace for not failing to provide resources and comfort along every step of the way. We saw with our eyes how God rescued her from death a few times. We continue to trust in Him for Danielle to fulfil God’s Holy plan. Someday in heaven, Danielle will have a glorious, fully functioning body which reflects the glory of God because Danielle is a blessed child of our Great and Loving God.
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>RDSS has been walking along us, providing some financial support through the Power For Life progam and the Medical Intervention Support (MIS) Scheme. It helps to subsidize part of our monthly electricity bill and medical consumables of Danielle. We also get to know and be connected with other parents are like us having a child with more medical challenges.</strong></p>
You may see that the present situation is and maybe difficult to carry on but press on ! We will soon see the light of the end of the tunnel. <em>Love is not Rare.</em>","Danielle Seah","Diagnosis: SMA Type 1","publish","open","open","","danielle-seah","","","2/10/2020 13:53:43","2/10/2020 05:53:43","","0","http://rdss.org.sg/dev/?post_type=stories&#038;p=89","0","stories","","0"

To my dearest Amelia,

It was 8 yrs ago that I vividly recalled how I held you close to my bosom in the delivery suite. When you were born, I was staring at you having tears welled in my eyes knowing how different you are gonna be with that big birthmark on your forehead almost over the highest point nearing your left eye socket area. Doctor says that the birthmark will never leave you. Frankly that doesn't make me love you less, your toddlers years weren't easy... Things gotten tougher after you slowly sinking into that state of unfounded diagnosis until today.. occasionally I found myself burying my tears on the pillow accepting the cruel reality that you are so trapped in a body liked of a 80 years old lady...

Sometimes I wonder how could we as your parents and family embrace that unconditional love and communicating with you without verbal exchange of languages.When you were 4 yrs old, God answered my prayers by allowing me to learn how your smacking of lips, swallowing your littlest saliva and blinking your eyes are so perfect n precious enough to run our daily communication with you. It seemed so easy to others, to us we knew it takes you a lot of efforts. For that we knew that you are already a child scoring A star always and forever you are our best child.

You never give up... you are always my little warrior princess ever and nobody would be a tougher cookie than you... My dearest sweetie Amelia..
<p style=""text-align: left;"">I rejoice each moment of my life becasue you are such a precious lesson... each day I seize every moment with u learning what is contentment and a thankful heart. You clearly brings out what is within mi that I can be a better person. Without you, I will never develop the fruits of patience and love.. You are a miracle and I knew that one day we will see Rainbow in your life like what your jiejie saw on her 8th birthday... she believes in you and so does daddy n mi...</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">This is something I have written to voice out your innermost feelings and believing that you will read it one day... <a href=""http://rdss.org.sg/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/P1090574-e1415691847937.jpg""><img class=""wp-image-619 size-medium alignright"" src=""http://rdss.org.sg/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/P1090574-e1415691847937-225x300.jpg"" alt="""" width=""225"" height=""300"" /></a></p>
I hope that this could truly encourages anybody whom is facing a tough time that you can be feeling so unjustified or bitter about it... Look beyond your outer self... search for a true self within and you discovered that you much stronger than you think...

Just dedicated for you Amelia and everyone out there whom needs this.

I am the child who cannot talk. You often pity me, I see it in your eyes. You wonder how much I am aware of. I see that as well. I am aware of much . . . whether you are happy or sad or fearful, patient or impatient, full of love or if you are just doing your duty by me. I marvel at your frustration, knowing mine to be far greater, for I cannot express myself or my needs as you do.

You cannot conceive my isolation, so complete it is at times. I do not gift you with clever conversation, cute remarks to be laughed over and repeated. I do not give you answers to your everyday questions, responses over my well being, sharing my needs, or comments about the world about me. I do not give you rewards as defined by the world's standards . . . great strides in development that you can credit yourself; I do not give you understanding as you know it.

What I give you is so much more valuable . . . I give you instead opportunities. Opportunities to discover the depth of your character, not mine; the depth of your love, your commitment, your patience, your abilities; the opportunity to explore your spirit more deeply than you imagined possible. I drive you further than you would ever go on your own, working harder, seeking answers to your many questions with no answers. I am the child who cannot talk.

I am the child who cannot walk. The world seems to pass me by. You see the longing in my eyes to get out of this chair, to run and play like other children. There is much you take for granted. I want the toys on the shelf, I need to go to the bathroom, oh I've dropped my fork again. I am dependant on you in these ways. My gift to you is to make you more aware of your great fortune, your healthy back and legs, your ability to do for yourself. Sometimes people appear not to notice me; I always notice them. I feel not so much envy as desire, desire to stand upright, to put one foot in front of the other, to be independent. I give you awareness. I am the child who cannot walk.

I am the child who is mentally impaired. I don't learn easily, if you judge me by the world's measuring stick, what I do know is infinite joy in simple things. I am not burdened as you are with the strife and conflicts of a more complicated life. My gift to you is to grant you the freedom to enjoy things as a child, to teach you how much your arms around me mean, to give you love. I give you the gift of simplicity. I am the child who is mentally impaired.

I am the disabled child. I am your teacher. if you allow me, I will teach you what is really important in life. I will give you and teach you unconditional love. I gift you with my innocent trust, my dependency upon you. I teach you about how precious this life is and about not taking things for granted. I teach you about forgetting your own needs and desires and dreams. I teach you giving. Most of all I teach you hope and faith. I am the precious child of yours and I am not a mistake.

Everyday is your birthday because you are strengthened by Him with His grace, love and mercy always....","Amelia Ng","Diagnosis : Unknown","publish","closed","open","","amelia-ng","","","17/7/2020 17:42:04","17/7/2020 09:42:04","","0","http://rdss.org.sg/?post_type=stories&#038;p=618","0","stories","","0"
"2103","1","13/12/2015 15:45:34","13/12/2015 07:45:34","Understanding Yihong.....

No one knows what our son is suffering from. Most doctors can only tell us that Yihong has developmental delay and that the cause is unknown. Yihong is six, but verbalising his thoughts is still foreign to him. He communicates with a mix of body language and a handful of words that he knows, like “there”, “banana” and “umbrella”. We have to observe his body language and behaviour to understand what he’s trying to say. Especially when he is unwell, it breaks our hearts that he cannot tell us where he’s comfortable.

During the first two years after I found out about my son’s condition were tough and would break down when talking about it. “Sometimes I would wake up in the middle of the night hoping it’s a dream I could wake up from,”

Luckily,  my hubby and I found support from other families after we joined the Rare Disorders Society (Singapore) few years ago.

The beginning....

I still remembers the day when the first sign of trouble began showing during my pregnancy. We were told there was “excess water at the neck area of the fetus"". We did not worry as we were told that only a small percentage of babies would have problems because of this.

Yihong was born normal but at two months old, he suddenly stopped sucking milk, almost as if he forgotten how to. The situation was so dire that our doctor suggested tube feeding, something I adamantly refused to do due to the possible complications that come with tube feeding like infections.

I tried to coax him into drinking small amounts of milk whenever he cried, indicating he was hungry, by cradling and rocking him in her arms. A few months later,we realised that Yihong, then four months old, could be slower than his peers when we realised he could not even lift up his neck.

The challenges....

Yihong spent his growing up years crawling. During this period, we sent him for countless physiotherapies at KKH , NUH and SPD hoping one day he can walk. Indeed our hard work pays off, when he’s at 4 years old, he took his first few steps independently. It was the greatest gift I had ever since I gave birth to him.

Sometimes going out with Yihong can lead to unwanted attention from the public. Resting on his nose bridge was a pair of prescripted glasses to correct his shortsightedness — a refractive error of -8.00 dioptres in each eye, or what is more commonly known as 800 degrees.

I recalled an incident when a woman stared at Yihong’s glasses, before signalling for “a whole kampung of people” to do the same. “I told her that Yihong is wearing glasses because he reads a lot and will grow up to be a professor. She walked away. I think she was embarrassed,”

The doctors recommended us to take Yihong overseas for more tests, or to go for CT (computed tomography) and MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scans. But the tests would just identify the cause but not finding a cure. Doctors told me the only way to improve Yihong’s quality of life is to go through therapies to improve his low muscle tones which are affecting his oral, motor skills, physical ability, eyesight etc.

He inspires....

From Yihong, we have learnt to take pride in every little milestone that he achieves.

“I think we are also learning from our son every day to not take things for granted,”

We are still positively waiting for the day that Yihong can speak to us.","Yihong","Diagnosis: Unknown","publish","closed","closed","","yihong","","","17/7/2020 17:41:20","17/7/2020 09:41:20","","0","http://rdss.org.sg/?post_type=stories&#038;p=936","0","stories","","0"
"2104","1","3/1/2016 10:46:12","3/1/2016 02:46:12","We are truly blessed with a beautiful daughter, Ruo En. Next month she turns 7. At a glance, she looks like a normal child. She is always so adorable with her cheerfulness and being cheeky. When Ruo En was one year old, she was diagnosed with a rare condition called schizenccephaly pachygyria, coupled with multiple disability like spastic dystonic quadriplegic cerebral palsy and hypertonia. All these impaired her movement, coordination, balance and posture.
<p style=""text-align: left;"">Despite her tender age, she went under the knives for an adductor release surgery in 2013. Due to <a href=""http://rdss.org.sg/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/rouen2.png""><img class="" wp-image-950 alignright"" src=""http://rdss.org.sg/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/rouen2.png"" alt=""rouen2"" width=""223"" height=""383"" /></a>hypertonia, there was a dislocation in her left and right hip. In 2014, Ruo En went for another 8 hours bone surgery to correct her hip dislocation issues again. 1 year after the surgery, Ruo En is now able to cycle on a tricycle, walk with assistance using a walker and even swim 3 laps with a float! These are the little (but big in our eyes) achievements and encouragement that keeps us going…</p>
On top of all the motor skills issues, her speech is also delayed. Ruo En is highly sociable despite facing great hindrances in expressing herself. Presently, she is undergoing the Oral placement Therapy, hoping that one day she will find her voice after her jaw muscle is strengthens.

At the Society for the Physically Disabled (SPD), she is being introduced to the Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC). This allows her to communicate and enabled her to share her inner world with all her love ones and friends.

Although Ruo En is our only child, her medical and daily expenses are high. Supporting a special needs child is very draining and demanding, both financially and emotionally. It is still a long journey for us, as well as for all the families with special needs child, in this special needs community.     However we are holding on to every little hope and chances, seeking for treatments, therapies that are beneficial to her. We want to improve her quality of life. Having said that, our greatest wish for her is to be highly independent, so that she can take care of her own daily living.

<p style=""text-align: left;"">During my pregnancy, the doctor did not detect any abnormalities and she was born a full term baby. Thing started to change when she was two months old as I discovered that she had seizures. <a href=""http://rdss.org.sg/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/2015-10-11-17.07.45.jpg""><img class=""wp-image-896 alignleft"" src=""http://rdss.org.sg/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/2015-10-11-17.07.45.jpg"" alt=""2015-10-11 17.07.45"" width=""189"" height=""252"" /></a>As first time parent, we thought she was just having some cramps on her feet. But it got worst and she started rolling her eyes and body started shaking too. We brought her to the hospital immediately and she was admitted for further investigation.</p>
Cheryll underwent blood tests, CT Scan and MRI during this period and it was suffering for us to see her going through all these. They came back with a diagnosis to her condition - Lissencephaly (flat brain)....

I couldn't accept the fact that my child has a rare condition and all I want to know was how this disease will effect Cheryll's development. Will she be suffering a lot? Is she going to have a lot of pain? Will she be badly affected by this condition? Can she lead a normal life? However, doctors couldn't advice at the moment because the severity each patients with Lissencephaly differ. We didn't choose to believe the diagnosis so we brought her home and hope for the best. We hope she will start to sit on her own, stand up, feed herself and finally call mom and dad. But all these didn't happen...

Despite not seeing improvement to Cheryll's condition, my husband and I refused to give up hope. Out of desperation, we turn to religion and fengshui to help with Chreyll’s condition. We even chose to believe that by changing her name will bring good luck and make her well. However, our effort did not make her better as she seizures got worst and the dosage to control it got higher and higher. The doctor even added extra <a style=""color:inherit;text-decoration:inherit;"" href=""https://handhhealth.com"" title=""Clomid"">medications</a> to attempt to control her seizures.

Through a family in Cheryll’s school, we were introduce to Osteopathic therapy. We started to send Cheryll for this therapy every week and after 10 sessions with the therapist, we were glad to notice some improvement on her. The frequency of getting seizures was reduced and she was more alert during classes in school. Recently, she started to make eye contact with us and the doctor has since reduced the dosage of her medication.

We are happy to see Cheryll making progress through Osteopathic therapy. But as a low income family<a href=""http://rdss.org.sg/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/cheryll.jpg""><img class=""wp-image-893 alignright"" src=""http://rdss.org.sg/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/cheryll.jpg"" alt=""cheryll"" width=""208"" height=""276"" /></a> (daddy is the sole breadwinner of the family), we couldn’t afford to bring her for regular therapy because each session cost $100 and we are looking at paying at least $800.00 to $1000.00 a month for her treatment.

At the moment, RDSS is helping the family with $400.00 of the therapy cost but this is not enough. We are hoping to raise some fund through RDSS and other crowdfunding portal to help our family with her therapy.

<div class=""row-fluid"">

I am the mother of Baby Yujia and we are raising funds for Yujia to get treatment at Boston Children's Hospital to fix her Esophagus.

Baby Yujia is born with esophageal atresia and multiple anomalies. It is a rare birth defect that unfortunately happens to her. She is not able to eat anything since her birth til now because her esophagus is not connected to her stomach. This requires definite surgery to join them together. It may sound simple but unfortunately it is not as easy as it seemed. She has been staying in hospital pretty much most of her life and recently just discharged but this is not the end of the story.

<b>Our Goal</b>
To be honest , we never thought we would be able to go for it. As soon as we know about the cost of the hospital bills, we didn't even dare to think about it. Because the fees are just too high for us. But everyday when I suction my baby (I need to suction her every 2-3hours), each time when I see her suffer, I felt I needed to do something. If today her saliva can flow down but cannot eat, I thought I could live with it. But the problem is she cannot even swallow her own saliva, not to mention any water and food. I thought we needed to do something. The determination grows stronger each day and finally I came across a similar case in Australia. I saw that the mummy is raising funds for her daughter to go to Boston Children's hospital and that is what really put me to set my mind on starting this campaign. I need to say that seeing them making so much effort to raise funds for their daughter gave us strength and hope too.

The Surgery medical bills is estimated at SGD 1.75 million. As we are not US citizen, we are not covered by any insurance should we go to Boston Children's Hospital for treatment. We hope to raise enough funds to her our baby girl to get her esophagus fixed and we really hope to see her eat by her mouth soon.

We really appreciate your kindness and hope that you can help us share our story and reach our goal. Your kind donation will help Baby Yujia to finally be able to eat by her mouth.

<b>Bringing Hope to Baby Yujia</b>
We just hope that our baby can be free from physical suffering and be happy. She has been through too much for her age. Yujia medical case is rare and complicated and our doctors here had already done their best. In Singapore, there is probably less than 10 known cases in the last 20 years. We searched online and found boston children's hospital and they specialised in treating such conditions. It seemed like our best choice and only way out. However the bills are too huge for us to bear therefore we decided to give it a shot through this fundraising platform and hope for the best.

All I hope is to see my daughter be free from physical suffering. And that's the least and the only thing I wish for. To help her solve the esophagus issue is definitely going to be life changing for her and for us. She cannot be like a normal kid right now , she cannot go out for too long, she cannot eat normally. And this can be treated. I really hope that this day will come when I can bring her out without bringing out the suction machine or worry she will get choke when she is sleeping at night and most importantly eat by mouth like you and I.

<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Journey of our child from the perspectives of Pei Shan’s parents</strong></p>
Pei Shan was born on 5th August 1998 in Mount Elizabeth Hospital in Singapore. She had been a normal and healthy baby throughout my pregnancy and at birth.

We brought her to private clinics in Bishan e.g. Woon Baby Clinic (Dr. Woon Kai Yong), The Bishan Family Doctors (Dr. Tan) for all her immunizations and <a href=""http://eradancetheatre.com/buy-cialis-online-usa/"" title='cialis' style=""color: #84898c; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;"">treatments</a> for normal flu and fever.

At 4 months old, Pei Shan was hospitalized in KK hospital due to Stridor (high-pitched wheezing sound produced due to obstructed air flow in the airways) and doctors noticed that her limbs were shorter than expected. As a result, she was diagnosed with the possibility of having developed Mucolipidosis (inherited metabolic disorder affecting the body’s ability to perform normal turnover of various materials within cells). However, we were advised by Prof. Anne Goh to monitor her further as girls tend to grow slower sometimes.

In order to seek a second opinion about her growth and development, we consulted Dr. Wong Hock Boon at Thomson Medical Centre, which had since become the place we headed to for any medical consultation, treatment and immunization for Pei Shan. Again, Dr. Wong assured us to not worry about her physical growth as it was also important to ensure a healthy mental development. We were advised to interact with her more in order to stimulate her brain to learn and explore what normal children were exposed to.

At 6 months old, Pei Shan was hospitalized in Mount Alvernia Hospital for 2 weeks due to chest infection, where she was treated by Dr. Woon.

At 9 months old, Mummy resigned from work to devote maximum time to take care of Pei Shan. We enrolled her in Tumble Tots classes in Thomson Plaza so that she could interact and play with other children of her age.

As we switched from dual income to Daddy being the sole breadwinner, medical fees and hospitalization bills became too expensive for us to afford. Therefore, we went back to KK Hospital for further medical treatments.

At age 1, Pei Shan was hospitalized in KK Hospital due to lung infection. Due to her short stature, doctors considered a case of Mucopolysaccharidosis Type III (MPS III), which was again not accepted as a proper diagnosis as MPS III could only be detected in children of age 5-6 and her symptoms were entirely different from that of MPS III. Doctors carried out a thorough check on her aberrant physical growth but could not identify a cause for her condition. We were disheartened to hear that there was no medication or cure, even up till date.

At age 2, Pei Shan attended Margaret Drive Special School for about a year. We observed that she had been more prone to infections, especially in places with many people. As a result, we were forced to stop her from attending school thereafter. Every infection landed her in high dependency ward for close monitoring. We wouldn’t forget that grave incident when she was seriously ill. Her oxygen level dropped to zero and she turned totally blue. She was immediately admitted to Children’s Intensive Care Unit (CICU) where we nearly lost her. Such events happened to her not once, but twice. From then on, even a mild flu was life threatening to her and we had to observe extensive hygiene to minimize her risk of infection.

</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class=""page"" title=""Page 2"">
<div class=""layoutArea"">
<div class=""column"">

At age 3, Pei Shan developed Obstructive Sleep Apnea (obstructed air-flow in the upper airways during sleep) and Restrictive Lung Disease (restricted lung expansion, resulting in extra force needed in breathing; patient risked of insufficient oxygen in body). To ensure that she gets a healthy supply of oxygen, she had to be put on continuous positive airway pressure ventilation as well as home oxygen concentrator for 24 hours everyday. Whenever we brought her on outings, we had to bring along heavy tanks of portable oxygen supply. Besides, she also had mild Aortic Regurgitation (leaking aortic valve of the heart causing blood to flow in the reverse direction during ventricular diastole).

From then on, Pei Shan had been on regular follow-up checks by the respiratory physician and cardiologist.

Down the years, whenever KK Hospital received medical professors from overseas to study specialized cases in Singapore, Pei Shan would be called back to KK Hospital for them to examine. So far, all of them had never seen a child with such an exceptional medical condition. They even commented on her being so unique that there wasn’t a second child in the world with the same condition.

At age 5, Pei Shan’s vulnerability to infections made us worried about the widespread threat caused by the SARS virus outbreak in that year. Whenever she had to be hospitalized for her conditions, she was specially arranged to stay in an isolated ward which clearly put the risk of an interpersonal infection to the bare minimum. We were extremely thankful for such an arrangement that kept her unaffected by the epidemic, leaving us a huge sigh of relief.

At age 7, Pei Shan vomited periodically and was hospitalized twice in KK Hospital due to low potassium levels. From then on, her dosage of medication had to be increased to maintain a healthy potassium level in her body.

At age 11, Pei Shan was diagnosed with Glaucoma (damage to optic nerve due to increased fluid pressure in eye). She had to have eye drops everyday in hope of easing the pressure. The medicinal strength of the eye drop had to be increased whenever the preceding prescription failed to lower the pressure. When even the strongest eye-drop could not lower the pressure in her eyes, a surgery was necessary.

At age 12, Pei Shan was scheduled for a TCP surgery to improve her vision. Transscleral Cyclophotocoagulation (TCP) was a laser treatment to the eye to lower the internal pressure. Doctors had huge concerns over her body’s ability to manage the general anaesthetics (GA) required for the surgery. Although the surgery would take merely 5 minutes, it might result in serious complications that could call for a longer hospitalization. We were in a huge dilemma – on one hand, agreeing to the surgery would confer high risks to her health; on the other hand, she would be blind without the surgery. We were also told that the surgery might not guarantee a reduction of the eye pressure and even so, the effects might not be long-lasting. We agreed to the surgery, nonetheless.

</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class=""page"" title=""Page 3"">
<div class=""layoutArea"">
<div class=""column"">

During the operation, after the GA had taken effect, we were told by the surgeon that he had a lot of difficulty inserting the incubating tube down Pei Shan’s throat, and it was not encouraged to repeat such a process if need be in the future i.e. it might not be possible to have a second TCP.

Day 1 after the surgery, Pei Shan rested in the high dependency ward. We saw that she had been repeatedly spitting out her own saliva, occasionally stained with blood, as she had trouble with swallowing. Whenever she tried to swallow, there would be an unbearable burning sensation in her throat possibly due to the abrasion by the incubating tube during the operation. We observed this only when we tried feeding her the potassium medicine orally, and she couldn’t help but to tell us about the pain. As a result, the doctor administered the medicine via the intravenous (I.V.) drip. To witness all of this suffering definitely broke our hearts. In the morning of Day 3, Mummy placed her ear near Pei Shan’s chest and was heartbreakingly appalled to hear her immense efforts in breathing very heavily. Mummy checked with Pei Shan if she was alright and all she asked of was to be hugged by Mummy. As obedient and strong as she always is, she fought hard to bear with such discomfort and torture that a typical 11-year-old might make a fuss about. Mummy immediately approached doctors and asked for transfer to ICU, where her oxygen requirement was so high that the ICU doctors suggested the need to open a hole through her neck to her respiratory tract to help with her breathing. However and thankfully, our own doctor, Dr Anne Goh arrived at the right moment and denied the need to perform such a process, and recommended Ventolin Puff (6 puffs every 15 minutes). Indeed, Pei Shan got better and returned to high dependency ward. Once again, we heaved a huge sigh of relief. Here, the doctor who administered the GA paid Pei Shan a visit and pleasantly surprised her with a soft-toy as a reward for her bravery. She commented that in her 10 years of experience, Pei Shan was the most challenging patient she had faced and she was very glad that the GA was successful. She was discharged after 9 days, when normal people could go home right after the TCP surgery, a proof of how minor the surgery was.

One and a half year later, as expected, Pei Shan’s eye pressure went up again. Since a second TCP was not possible, our doctor suggested a major operation involving certain changes to her facial appearance as a last resort to counter the effect glaucoma was having on her vision. A second opinion from the eye specialist was against this operation as her heart might not be able to manage it. Moreover, Pei Shan did not want to do the surgery as well.

“I rather go blind, than to go through all the pain and torture to my body that an operation brings”, Pei Shan said.

Pei Shan is big enough to deserve the right of deciding what’s best for herself, and we definitely respect that.

At age 13, Pei Shan was found to have an overproduction of mucus in her airways, resulting in a lot of phlegm which she had to use up all her energy to cough out. Sometimes we even had to help her with the purging of phlegm by patting her on her sides and as she was doing so, she turned blue almost every time. As a result, we had to deliberately raise the oxygen level to a 6 from her normal 2.5. Hence we’d always have a huge oxygen tank as a standby for occasions like this where she had to purge the phlegm, which has been becoming as regular as once every morning. Doctors prescribed medicine to help ease the mucus thickening but our brave girl decided not to rely on the medicine and to cough out the phlegm on her own, which was highly encouraged by the doctor as well. This may just be another symptom from her undiagnosed condition but to us, it seemed to be a likely repercussion from the TCP surgery a year ago, as we were informed of the risks that the surgery might confer on her health.

</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class=""page"" title=""Page 4"">
<div class=""layoutArea"">
<div class=""column"">

At age 14, Pei Shan was hospitalized again for sudden breathlessness. Usually, her shortness of breath can be relieved via ventolin puffs, however, the frequency between each puff became very short and when the puffs did not seem to help anymore, we admitted her to the hospital. Doctors carried out several thorough checks on her blood protein level, heart condition and everything was alright. However, Pei Shan’s body was noticed to have developed slight edema and she was prescribed diuretics to reduce body swells. Also, she was discouraged from high salt intake in order to minimize water retention within her body.

There is, however, one lingering worry that haunts us from deep within – Pei Shan is our only child, and as she grows up, age catches up on the both of us as well. Who is going to take care of her, should anything happen to either of us? It definitely doesn’t take one only a few days to be able to know how to take care of her intricate condition. It took us so many years, one step at a time, to be careful of every single detail. Even so, Daddy, who has been working doesn’t manage as well as Mummy, who has been spending all 24 hours with Pei Shan every single day.

Nonetheless, we’re thankful for each and every moment we have with her and we do believe that there will always be a brighter tomorrow. We do not give up on our little angel.

<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Pei Shan’s artistic pursuits</strong></p>
Though born with the long history of medical conditions, our girl does have some bold artistic interests that she actively pursues. Pei Shan has been home schooled since young due to her medical conditions. Despite that, she is able to write, draw and colour very well. Above all, she loves music and dreams to learn to play the piano. It all started when Pei Shan tinkered with a small toy piano at the tender age of 3. We felt very fortunate when our friend started teaching Pei Shan how to play basic music on a keyboard when she was 8 years old.

Last December 2013, Pei Shan was invited to attend an audition which would permit her enrolment as a music student with the Beautiful Mind Music Academy (BMMA). Little did we realize that the audition on 25 January 2014 was the golden key that unlocked a whole new chapter in Pei Shan’s life.

Pei Shan’s Journey with Beautiful Mind Music Academy (BMMA)

BMMA is a free music program offered by Beautiful Mind Charity (BMC) for potential artists with disabilities to fully develop their artistic talents as professional musicians by undergoing training customised to their individual special needs.

BMMA’s music teacher, Ms Mary Yoon started teaching Pei Shan on 13 February 2014 at our home. The lesson was one hour per week, which gradually increased to twice weekly in preparation for the Beautiful Mind Charity's Concert 'Begining of Another Miracle' on 19 April 2014.

When we asked Pei Shan if she was nervous, she would always reply “No”, with a confident expression. Her courage and enthusiasm in learning with Teacher Mary came as a very pleasant surprise. She would look forward to every lesson and diligently practise on her own for hours before the next lesson. We are very pleased to watch her become more self-disciplined and determined in learning music.

What really took us by surprise was her ability to perform on a grand piano confidently on the day of the concert at School of the Arts (SOTA) alongside many passionate and talented musicians.

“As Pei Shan came onto stage, I could feel the whole aura of pride radiating from my family. Her tiny palms moving so agilely from one key to another on the grand piano as she calmly performed her piece. In another duet with her music Teacher Mary, Pei Shan made me grin widely and silently shouting, HEY THAT’S MY COUSIN. I’m sure last night meant the world to her, as I’d completely understand when I had my first stage performance in 2004”, said Pei Shan's favourite cousin, Yu Jing.

Everyone got so excited over her, but nothing would beat our jittering nerves. As her parents, we felt so proud to witness her perform in her first concert. After her performance that night, it moved us deeply as our little girl played her heart out for us. She told us she wanted mummy and papa to enjoy her performance. We want to thank BMMA for giving Pei Shan this learning opportunity and Teacher Mary for her dedication and love in teaching her. It is our hope that Pei Shan will continue in her music education and fulfil her dream as a musician one day. We want Pei Shan to continue playing beautiful music and contribute to the society. She is the sunshine in our lives whom we want to share with others. We knew that was a great night for Pei Shan when she clapped her hands and said “Mummy, I am happy!” Unafraid of the stage, she added “I want to play for thousands of people!”

Apart from her music pursuits, Pei Shan draws actively in her free time. She wishes that the beautiful art pieces she had drawn over the years can all be published into a book, each with a short meaningful caption. Drawing has always brought joy to her life and she hopes to spread love and smiles to others through her drawings.

Pei shan has turned 16 this August. We are thankful for her positive outlook on life despite not sharing many opportunities that other healthy teenagers of her age get to experience.

As the parents of Pei Shan, our only hope for her is to stay healthy and be happy everyday. Simple joy and health is bliss.

Diagnosis: SMA Type 1

Kaelyn was born in February 2012. She came out to this world crying loudly, probably just like any normal baby.

3 months down the road, physically she was growing but her head was floppy and she missed her developmental milestone.

We were at the paediatrician for a routine visit when we were advised to bring Kaelyn to a neurologist for a check.

We went and the neurologist saw her floppiness and suspected SMA (Spinal muscular Atrophy). That was the day we first hear of this genetic condition. That day Kaelyn's blood was drawn and submitted to test for SMA.

We read up online on the symptom of the disease. Everything seem to fit. But we were hoping for the best still as the results weren't out.

The words of the neurologist sank in. We were devastated. Tears flowed when the thought of Kaelyn's prognosis came to mind.

The 3 weeks wait for the test results was agonizing. But when it came out, it just confirmed the neurologist's suspicion. Kaelyn was positive for SMA.

She is unable to lift her head, flip herself over or even sit up on her own. She may never will. Her body will lose control of her muscles and it will atrophy. Every body function that requires muscles will be affected. From lifting her head, limbs, breathing, swallowing, feeding and even speech will be affected.

SMA is a degenerative disease. This means as time progresses, she will only grow weaker.

Kaelyn was hospitalized in her 10th month for a collapsed lung. She caught a virus 1 week into the hospital stay and ended up in ICU, fighting for her life. She was hospitalized for a month.

She survived that episode. She came back home, but with a collection of equipment (BiPap, oximeter, suction machine, milk feed pump, oxygen cylinder) in tow.

We paid fully for her equipment as we weren't under any medical fund assistance or covered by insurance at that time.

She has to be on the BiPap for almost 24 hours to assist her breathing as she does not have the strength to breath sufficiently on her own for long. She only takes her BiPap off for her bath daily.

Oxygen is supplemented if she is unable to keep up her oxygen saturation level due to illness or she is unable to handle her secretions.

She has a oximeter tied to her extremities all the time except bath time. This is for us to monitor her vital stats.

She also has to be on continuous feed for 18 hours a day as normal feeding has the risk of aspiration for her plus her swallowing is very weak. She does love the taste of fresh apple slices, licking it (she can't chew hard enough or swallow) for the flavor.

She is currently doing well at home and always enjoys a good song or story telling by family and friends or the company of little kids her age.

She has her blog http://kaelyn-a-day.blogspot.com/ where we update her activities and happenings to serve as reference and memory for us.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Little Kaelyn passed away peacefully in April 2015. The parents didn't see it coming but they have learned to accept it. Letting her go is the best for her and the family.

Parents of Caelen Lam:
Lam Kam Choy (Mr)
Lowell Tan (Ms)

Caelen was born a healthy full term baby in March 2013. He was eating well and growing up like any normal child except that he was slightly slower in attaining his developmental milestones. We thought nothing of it initially, thinking that boys generally develop slower. Caelen met his first milestone of rolling over at five and a half months old and could lift his head and chest while lying on his tummy.

Things took a turn when he was six and a half months old. We noticed a lack of limb reflexes and he was still floppy at this juncture. Arms movements were limited and he was only comfortable reaching out within close proximity - usually less than an arm’s length away. His lack of leg movements became more significant and he made no attempt to kick, sit or crawl on his own. Sitting with assistance proved difficult, demonstrating a poor sense of balance and weak trunk control. Although Caelen was still growing up and developing, it was at a painfully slow pace. In fact, he was actually deteriorating over time.

In January 2014, Caelen was diagnosed with Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) Type 1. SMA is caused by a missing or abnormal (mutated) gene known as Survival Motor Neuron Gene 1 (SMN1). The absence of the SMN1 gene results in muscular weakness that affects one’s gross motor skills as well as one’s ability to feed and breathe. This condition is degenerative in nature and Caelen will gradually lose the muscular ability required to function; and become bedridden or dependent on a special wheel chair for mobility. He will also require interventions such as tube-feeding and respiratory support to keep him alive. The prognosis for SMA Type 1 patients is poor, with the majority not being able to live past the age of two due to the ever looming threat of respiratory insufficiency and other resulting complications.

Nonetheless, our hopes for Caelen to grow up well and healthy and to reach more milestones (perhaps not physically but cognitively and intellectually) remain the same. Caelen recently celebrated his first birthday. Now, at just 14 months old, he has shown us what he can be capable of by demonstrating a strong ability to communicate effectively to make up for his immobility.

Please help us realise his true potential.

<p style=""color: #989898;"">On 19 February 2010, we embraced the arrival of a new member into our family. This new addition, Xin Er,  we thought, was the best gift and greatest happiness that God had bestowed upon us.</p>
<p style=""color: #989898;"">Sadly, on 1 September 2010, Xin Er was admitted to hospital for bronchitis. On the second day of hospitalization, doctors discovered irregularities in her heart rate. She was then transferred to the Intensice Care Unit (ICU) after the medical staff administered three rounds of emergency resuscitation. She experienced breathing difficulties and had to be assisted by an incubator. The doctors also broke the news that our daughter had been diagnosed with a rare genetic disorder called Pompe Disease and warned us to be mentally prepared for the worst. Even if she survived this ordeal, doctors informed that, statistically, patients with this disorder would not live beyond their first birthday! Our world crumpled that very moment.</p>
<p style=""color: #989898;"">Despite all the negativity that surrounded us, like most parents in similar situations, we were in a state of denial. We were hopeful and strongly believed in our daughter, the mighty warrior, that she would be able to pull through this. Little Xin Er heard our cries, felt our confidence and hopes in her. She 'grit her teeth', braved the storm and conquered the war. After a month of battling with the symptoms of the disease, our angel was finally discharged from the hospital on 2 October. Thereafter, Xin Er had been conscientiously going for her fortnightly Enzyme Replacement Treatment (ERT), which was a lifetime treatment. .... Every journey to the hospital was always filled with fear and anxiety. We feared that Xin Er might get choked by her own secretion along the way, though we always had an oxygen canister and other necessary medical equipment in the car. We felt like we were traveling in an ambulance each time. How many could really comprehend and empathize with our situation and feeling?</p>
<p style=""color: #989898;"">It pained us, as parents, to see our precious little angel, having to suffer the pain of pricking needles regularly and the dreaded symptoms of the disease. She was such a cheerful and active baby. Nonetheless, Xin Er never faltered. She fought hard and brave. We drew strength and inspiration from her. She taught us the value of life. While her life expectancy remained an unknown to all of us, we believe in the quality of life and treasuring every moment we spent with one another. Even a minute of precious time together, it could last a lifetime!</p>
<p style=""color: #989898;"">Xin Er, we love you and we will never let go. You will never walk alone!</p>
<p style=""color: #989898;"">****************************************************************************</p>

Born in 9th February 2006, starting promisingly with a 10/10 APGAR score, with body height top 95 percentile, Aleks is everything any proud parent want in her/his child. “Aleks got my eyes…, he sure has my good gene…, he’s as beautiful as me…”, both my husband and I staked our claims in the maternity ward. In spite of the controversy, Aleks came into our world and made such a beautiful impact, a sprightly boy with his infectious smile who brings exultations to everyone around him. His arrival brought new meaning to the insouciance we sought to grow as a family.

During Alek’s routine check-up when he was six-month old, his pediatrician noticed something was not right with him. Aleks’ blood count was extremely low with enlarged spleen and liver. Subsequently, for the next two years, Aleks made several visits to hostipals and specialists and unerwent numerous blood tests without any conclusive diagnosis. I decide to take a short break begining 2008, after working for more than fifteen years, longing to dedicate more time with Aleks with his undiagnosed medical condition and his older brother, Tyrone, who was then starting his first year in promary school.

In December 2008, Aleks was diagnosed with Gaucher Disorder a rare genetic disorder virtually unknown in this part of our world. He is believed to be the first and only patient to be diagnosed with it in Singapore. Confronted by the abyss below, one of the first steps we took was to write and/or meet with medical professionals, drug companies and foreign rare genetic disorder organisations/ societies seeking guidance and sharing their experiences. We were indeed gratuitous for it opened up our eyes that help was not rare even from without when we asked. Then we learnt that for Alek’s case, the only approved drug for treatment (by other national health authorities) that was available is an enzyme called Cerezyme which is produced by the pharmaceutical firm, Genzyme. We too are in contact with another company whose treatment drugs are still on clinical trials and awaiting approval from FDA of USA.

The prices for Cerezyme and other ""orphan drugs"" are very expensive. The cumulative dosage for Cerezyme is positively correlated to the weight of the patient. Aleks now weighs eighteen kilograms and will require four vials of Cerezyme for his treatment (or Enzyme Replacement Therapy, or ERT for short) a two-weekly intravenous infusion of this drug. The estimated total cost for his annual dosage of Cerezyme work out to be SGD150,000.00. We came to know doctors caring for patients with rare genetic disorders in Singapore had attempted to put forward the tenets that the authority should fund what is standard of care for their patients but until now to no avail even though these drugs have been proven to ""reduced morbidity and mortality"". For these exceptional women and men, getting these expensive drugs listed as ""Standard Drug List"" means their patients can have ready access to them.

In July 2009, Aleks was inflicted with H1N1 influenza A which rapidly turned into pneumonia. He spent more than a month in the Intensive Care Unit. For all my life, I could not remember being so helpless. I stayed in the hospital for more than a month with Aleks, visited the temple almost daily, praying for Aleks recovery. I seek every doctor I know or, yes, within my sight to help Aleks. I remembered a very senior doctor who visited Aleks told me that Aleks was a very sick child and that I have to be strong. I saw and comprehended from a distance some nurses and doctors telling my husband to take care of me and that I need to be strong. I am strong and sound, I told them, but please, I beg you all to help Aleks.

Today, we are most grateful to the team of doctors and nurse who saved Aleks. Once off the invasive respiratory support system and was conscious, Aleks initially fought hard to remove the respiratory aids, which looked unfamiliar and threatening and was definitely very uncomfortable for his delicate physique. We told him, as the bravest child, he was chosen, to be on a very important mission and has to train as a jet fighter pilot, thus the need for the oxygen mask. He gave a selfreassured smile and that when he went along with the “mission”. There it was, our brave Aleks, on a “pilot training” sortie and away from the jaws of mortality.

Aleks has been going for the two-weekly Cerezyme ERT at KK Women’s and Children’s Hospital for almost two years and is very much better now. Look at him, so full of life, bright, cheerful, and at times mischievous, very much like any other five- year old boy, except that he has to make a trip to the hospital twice a month and spend about five to six hours there to replace the missing enzyme in his body via intravenous infusion and braving the now familiar “needle” insertion.

Following are Aleks’s very encouraging medical results from Cerezyme ERT:

• Spleen has reduced from 25 cm to under 10 cm • Liver has reduced from 5 cm to 2 cm • Hemorrhagic count has increased from 9.5 g/dL to 13.1 g/dL • Palette count increase from 50,000 to 100,000 per ?l of blood (150–450 x 109/L) • Human plasma chitotriosidase level measured in December 2010 was at 2,322 nmol/ml/h, a vast reduction from 8,030 nmol/ml/h obtained in January 2009

Thrust into the Gaucher world, we remain positive and really want to be able to persist and function like a normal family and to bring up children whose dreams and aspirations must not be impeded by ""permanent"" obstacles. On our own we will do our best to see that Aleks will be well and have a bright future.

Meanwhile, little Aleks, as his cheerful self, continue to charm people around him with his wits and infectious smile. The intravenous infusion of ERT, twice monthly, has not oppress our cheerful Aleks, instead Aleks is now, the little ambassador in the Children Therapy Unit, reassuring other children, not to be fear of the intravenous infusion.

“It’s not pain, see, doctor set plug for me, I did not cry”

Even though, at this moment, Gaucher patient may need live long treatment, we choose to see light at the end of the tunnel, reading encouraging medical news, medical profession finding great break through, which may lead to possible cure for Gaucher disorder.

As a patients parent, we hope to raise awareness of the rare disorder, the right for survivor, and the need for treatment beyond economics and politics.

At 18 weeks we found out in KKH (2nd opinion) that he is also Beta Thalassemia Major and has a big hole in the heart (VSD) requiring repair at birth. I gave birth to him in KKH and at 2 weeks old he undergone 3 heart surgeries the 3rd one being an emergency open heart heart to rectify the 1st &amp; 2nd. He had such traumatic post op experience that both his lungs collapsed. As a result he was on CPAP &amp; O2 for almost 4 years (chronic lungs). He started blood transfusion since his heart surgeries, and due to that, we overlooked aspects of his Thalassemia i.e chelation regime which was not started promptly. We struggled with his multi disciplinary medical needs, keeping him breathing was already difficult
<div>let alone managing the Thalassemia. His spleen and liver got so big, he suffered chronic anemia and hepatosplenomegaly, which required his spleen to be taken out at a tender age of 2. We managed to save his spleen by doing an experimental procedure which worked to shrink his spleen. His spleen was so huge he was suspected of Gaucher, and of course we ran all kinds of tests and all. Then we got our acts together with help of 2 hospitals and Msian doctors and my research with other patients support group abroad and we realised we had mismanaged his Thalassemia. Details that don't matter to others can make or break my little guy! The heart surgeries caused damaged nerve to his left vocal cord, so his voice was hardly audible until recently. He was PEG fed until after he started eating last year in May @4yo. We had in total 8 GAs the last one was removal/closure of his PEG. He's been doing extremely well and next year we are going to Bangkok for a reduced intensity bone marrow transplant. The donor is my no.2 son. It will be coordinated and assisted by NUH team.

Vera was born full-term by Cesarean at 1.9kg. She was diagnosed shortly after with Trisomy 18. This feisty girl is among the rare 10% of T18 infants who do survive beyond their 1st year. Despite her medical issues, she continues to defy her death-sentence diagnosis. She enriches our lives, just by being alive. Vera was cared for by daddy full-time in her first year, and now it's mommy's turn. She recently became big sister to baby brother Daen (pronounced ""Day-ian"").
<div>In 2013, she had 2 hospital stays - one in June and another in December - both for gastro-enterological infection, with prolonged bouts of Diarrhea.</div>
<div></div>
<div>So far we are averaging 2 hospital stays a year, so I'd say she's doing alright.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Here are some updates that we are very thankful for:</div>
<div></div>
<div>1) <b>Fits</b>: Vera's myoclonic jerks (fits) have not resurfaced since September 2012, when she was put on fit medication Epilim. The course of treatment is 2 years, so by September 2014 if she stays fit-free, we can be on our way to weaning off the medication.</div>
<div></div>
<div>2) <b>Breathing:</b> Vera's biPAP breathing requirement setting has remained largely the same. Results from the sleep study done end of 2012 are out and her requirement is 15/5. This is lower than the 15/7 she is currently on. This is the first time the settings have gone down instead of an expected increase. This is a reassurance that she is well supported for her breathing during sleep, or that she is growing stronger and doing more of the breathing work herself.</div>
<div></div>
<div>3) <b>Gripping:</b> Vera has starting to grip simple objects with her right hand. She has gradually become more open to holding things, even if it is for a few seconds.</div>
<div></div>
<div>4) <b>Kicking:</b> She has discovered the joy of kicking, and loves it best when in the pool. Feeling her move so freely and joyfully in the water makes me wish I could bring her swimming every day.</div>
<div></div>
<div>5) <b>Visiting:</b> We brought her out to more CNY house parties this year. When she was young, she hardly visited, for fear of infection. We're happy that she's stayed healthy throughout the festive period.</div>

"2088","1","16/4/2014 11:22:40","16/4/2014 11:22:40","<strong>My angel, Francesca!</strong>

It was an early morning in month of May 2008 when I found Francesca, my 4months old baby gal looking lethargic and seems sleepy most of the time.  She has been throwing up her milk frequently over the last one week, we have seen GP and her Pediatrician but all said it is a common symptom of baby influx of milk or maybe indigestion.  She looks really dry as she couldn’t stomach her milk each time we feed her.

Noticing that she is not in her normal self, as she is a very active and happy baby, we quickly sent her to KKH. Doctors and nurses surrounded her and put her on drip since she has been quite dehydrated. I requested to breastfeed her with some milk as Francesca was crying out for milk. Doctor said “only a little please”.  Both my hubby and I were in anxiety and confused as doctor seems quite concerned over her condition. I thought it would be just any normal baby milk influx or like GP said indigestion.

Francesca was ward into the High Dependency Ward as they wanted to put her under observation and perhaps conduct more tests to determine her condition. There was an order from the doctor to conduct a blood test on her every hour. My heart hurts with every prick on her little finger and she cried out loud. She is a very chubby baby and with very fair skin, hence doctors had a hard time looking for her vein to draw out blood. Each time they need to call a Senior Medical officer or a Registrar when they need to draw out blood for tests.  I cried with her. I couldn’t bear with her cries, my husband stayed with her when they drew the curtain to do the blood test, I chose to walk out and not hear or see anything. Within a few hours, she has plasters all over her ten little fingers, and prick holes can be seen. It’s been most heartbreaking moment for me when I see my four months old baby suffering through this..

After one day, she seems better and thriving again as a happy baby. Doctor had also lessened the number of blood tests so that our little gal won’t be too stressed out and could have a good rest. I thought the ordeal would be over and we can go home soon. But no..

Finally, the Registrar brought a Specialist to us; I remembered it was a Saturday. The Specialist was Dr. Tan Ee Shien who specialized in Genetic Disorder conditions. We were lucky as Dr. Tan was on duty that weekend, and the Registrar has informed Dr. Tan about our gal’s condition and she decided to come and review her. She saw Francesca and informed the hospital that a special test would need to be conducted. So more bloods were taken and as it was a weekend and the test needs a few days to revert since it is done overseas, Francesca got to stay on and be observed for few more days.

Monday, Tuesday came and Francesca looks really good and active. I was happy hoping that all seems ok and the test that Dr. Tan did would only be a routine check and everything should be fine.  I went down for dinner alone as hubby was at work.  Shortly, I received a call from a Senior Doctor and Dr Tan wanting to see me immediately, they sounded serious. They said my daughter has this condition called Methylmalonic Acidemia. I couldn’t make out what is that as it seems so foreign to me.  My heart was thumping. I called my hubby and he came back to the hospital immediately.

We met both Doctors in the Parent counseling room. I remembered we were both staring at the doctors when they told us again my daughter has been diagnosed with a metabolic disorder condition call Methylmalonic Acidemia, in short MMA. First reaction was “What’s that”?... Dr. Tan looked really serious and explained the condition to me. I stared in disbelief and tears started rolling down uncontrollably, asking “why my little girl”?... That night, we both sat in our car and started crying, I seen my hubby for the first time looking all vulnerable..

<strong>What is MMA?</strong>

There are only few MMA cases in Singapore and this is a rare condition. There is no family history of such condition in my family trees. MMA is a genetic metabolic disorder where the patient has a short of protein enzyme to digest or breakdown protein. That means for life, Francesca has to be on a strict protein restriction diet and she needs special medications for life. Any excess of protein build up in her body could be fatal. So her diet needs to be carefully managed to ensure there is no short or excess of protein daily.

KKH’s Doctor and Nurses have been really good and doting on Francesca however we do feel that we need more support and assistance in administering what is critical in her dietary.

<strong>How we feel about the current support from KKH?</strong>

Her daily dietary includes special milk powder that are protein free (Prophree), and another milk powder (Propimex 1) with ‘good’ protein for her growth. And drinks it at least 4 times a day. These 2 milk powders are only available from Abbott International, a pharmaceutical company who specialized in such special products. The costs of both Milk powders are almost doubled of what are the common milk products on supermarket shelf. The initial purchasing of this milk powder was done via KKH dietary department as these are controlled and can only be brought in from US.  However KKH decided to pass the distribution back to Abbott, and subsequently this year back to KKH again.

Early this year when KKH took back to process the order, they decided to increase the price of each can of milk to about a 20% higher. Substantially higher from previous, and is a toll financially for all. Each time we need to make a 6 months advance order and we have to order in bulk as this is a daily dietary for MMA patient. So you can imagine the cost for each order and with this 20% increase, I can imagine how much burden it is weighing on family with low income.  KKH explanation is that this is to support their administration of the ordering and distributing the milk formulas. But it is not a justifiable increase, considering that such milk formulas are for needy children with special conditions and is not a luxury item per se.

KKH as a public organization and if their motto is ‘We put our patients first at the heart if all we do’. However, do they advocate that value if administering an order of milk formula means putting the financial burden on the children and the family? We hope to seek the support and assistance from the relevant body to review this.","Francesca Lim","Diagnosis: Methylmalonic Acidemia","publish","open","open","","francesca-lim","","","16/4/2014 11:22:40","16/4/2014 11:22:40","","0","http://rdss.org.sg/dev/?post_type=stories&amp;p=118","0","stories","","0"

My ""Little Boy""

Hi, I'm a full time working mum to 3 kids age 8, 6 and 3 years old.
My youngest was officially diagnosed with achondroplasia when he is 2 months old with a blood test done in KKH. Achondroplasia is a form of dwarfism, short stature with short upper arms and limbs.

His story started when I was pregnant with him at 28 weeks.
At a normal 3rd trimester check-up with my gynae, when doing the measurement, he detected my baby’s upper limbs are shorter than normal. Since he had a case before similar as mine, he was saying my boy could have achondroplasia. My mind instantly became blank, I was in a shock. I had 2 older kids and they were all normal. I’m still 31 and my husband 32 years old and we've never resorted to using <a href=""http://laganvalley.co.uk/sales-viagra-online/"">viagra</a> like the others, we were still consider young, and how can we have a genetic problem! During the 20 weeks detailed scan, everything was normal, therefore he called for another detailed scan at week 32.

The next 4 weeks passed like a torture, I kept on eating, thinking that he may not have enough nutrition, therefore not growing. Then came the 32 weeks detailed scan, enlarged kidney, short femur length… result showed signs of achondroplasia. I was devastated, my world came crashing down. I did not know what to do. Doctor suggested me to give birth at 37 weeks due to his larger head. The rest of the weeks till birth, I was in a zombie state… I went to web and searched achondroplasia, all information were scarily, still birth, bowed leg, osa, ear infection, kyphosis…

At 37 weeks, I was induced and gave birth to my little boy. At first look, my gynae confirmed his suspicion, my boy had achondroplasia with his short femur, bell shaped belly, larger head and no nasal bridge. Due to my case, he had already arranged a paediatrician on standby. The paediatrician came in shortly, examined him and he too confirmed his case and sent my boy for an x-ray. Even though both doctors had confirmed his diagnose, I denied the fact. I cried all the way to the ward. No one dare to talk to me, my one understand my feeling. Thoughts came by, how am i going to cope in future, how am I going to overcome all the difficulties due to his special. Every night I was crying to myself, praying that all these were not real… I looked at my boy, he is such a sweet boy, but why must his fingers be curved, his bone short…  I denied the fact and pretended like nothing of big deal happen during the day but at night when I was alone, I was crying…

After discharged, there was once my sister dropped by my house to help me run errand. She saw that I was sad and talked to me. She said “He is your boy, if you don't pick yourself up then, no one will be able to help him.” These words immediately knocked sense into me, I had got to help myself before I can help him. I went through the web again and search in forum for support. There is no helpful find in Singapore and I went to oversea forum. It was in US Baby Centre forum that I came across some mummies posting about achondroplasia and if anyone needs support, to email them. I emailed a few mummies, and to my surprise, the next few days, they replied my mail. They eased my worries and answer all my doubts. They were saying it’s not the end of the world, it’s the start of a new world, my boy will bring me more satisfactory happiness than any of my kids. They provided me tons of medical info, how to handle my boy, what not to do and do with my boy, things to look out for… My mind became cleared after months of denials, I must help my boy overcome all his difficulties, be it medical, social or mentally…

When I went back to my gynae for review, I told him my worries and he recommended 2 genetic doctors for my boy to follow up with. I immediately called KKH and NUH and made appointments with them. The operators were kind enough to give me a slot as soon as possible and the very next week, my boy went to see them. Both doctors were kind enough to let my boy be in subsidised rate even though he went to them without referral as he will need to see them for the rest of his life. He was also given an option whether or not to go for a blood test to confirm his diagnose, we agreed as we wanted a closure for his diagnose. Through my doctor, I also got to know Kenneth, who is the VP of RDSS. Through him, I had got advices and cheaper supply of my boy necessities…  There were events arranged by RDSS for parents of special need kids to mingle around too.

Cut it short now, he's 3, he had brought lots of joy to my life. Even though he is slow in his development, he had got his own ways to reach his milestone, he can’t crawl on all fours but he does army crawl. The way he smiles is memorising, very sweet. He got severe OSA of which he need a bipap during sleep. He also got frequent ear infection which need him to have ear tubes put in. Right now we are dealing with his moderate hearing loss which require him to see a speech therapist and maybe a hearing aid soon…

I don’t know what lies for him in future but one thing for sure, I will be there for him. I hope in Singapore, Government will give more supports for parents like us to deal with our special need kids. People will be more open minded, also not to let bullying take place…

Issac is was diagnosed with Rubinstein-Taybi Syndrome (a.k.a. broad thumb-hallux syndrome) at birth. There is no cure for Issac's condition and symptomatic treatments will be given to him throughout his life. Intermittently, one or more surgeries might be needed to correct certain issues related to the disorder. He was also diagnosed with gastrointestinal issues, heart defects, facial defects, speech and language delay and many others issues related the disorder.

His mother, who was the sole breadwinner, had to give up her job to care for him full time. Her family members were burdened by their own financial difficulties and hence unable to help with his treatment costs fully.

Issac was referred to the Society to help with emotional and financial support that could bring light to his life. Through the Society outing, Issac was linked to other children with rare disorders and this improved his communication skills. He has since entered into an early intervention program and has continued to show great improvement.

Issac and his mother have demonstrated that there is indeed light at the end of the tunnel and all they really need is someone like you to offer continuous support to them.","Issac Tan","Diagnosis: Rubinstein-Taybi Syndrome ","publish","open","closed","","issac-tan","","","16/4/2014 08:32:31","16/4/2014 00:32:31","","0","http://rdss.org.sg/dev/?post_type=stories&amp;p=107","0","stories","","0"
