# West Syndrome

### Disease Overview
West Syndrome is a rare and severe form of epilepsy that typically begins in infancy, characterized by a specific type of seizure called infantile spasms and an abnormal brain wave pattern known as hypsarrhythmia. The condition is often associated with significant developmental challenges and can have long-term neurological implications.

### Disease Category
Neurological Disorder; Epileptic Syndrome; Developmental Epileptic Encephalopathy

### Synonyms
- Infantile Spasms
- Epileptic Spasms
- Generalized Flexion Epilepsy
- Infantile Epileptic Encephalopathy

### Signs & Symptoms
- Characteristic infantile spasms (sudden, synchronous muscle contractions)
- Developmental regression or significant developmental delay
- Hypsarrhythmia (chaotic, abnormal EEG brain wave pattern)
- Clusters of brief, symmetric muscle spasms
- Loss of previously acquired motor and cognitive skills
- Potential intellectual disability
- Increased irritability
- Abnormal muscle tone

### Causes
- Genetic mutations (ARX, CDKL5, STXBP1 genes)
- Structural brain abnormalities
  - Tuberous sclerosis
  - Cortical dysplasia
  - Brain malformations
- Metabolic disorders
  - Pyridoxine dependency
  - Mitochondrial disorders
- Prenatal and perinatal factors
  - Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy
  - Intrauterine infections
  - Chromosomal abnormalities
- Acquired brain injuries

### Affected Populations
- Primarily infants between 3-12 months of age
- Incidence: Approximately 1-5 per 10,000 live births
- Equal gender distribution
- Higher risk in premature infants

### Disorders with Similar Symptoms
- Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome
- Dravet Syndrome
- Early Myoclonic Encephalopathy
- Ohtahara Syndrome
- Epileptic Encephalopathy

### Diagnosis
- Comprehensive clinical evaluation
- Detailed patient and family medical history
- Electroencephalogram (EEG) to detect hypsarrhythmia
- Neuroimaging studies
  - Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)
  - Computed Tomography (CT) scans
- Genetic testing
- Metabolic screening
- Developmental assessment

### Standard Therapies
- Pharmacological interventions
  - Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)
  - Vigabatrin
  - Corticosteroids
  - Antiepileptic medications
- Dietary therapies
  - Ketogenic diet
  - Modified Atkins diet
- Surgical interventions (in specific cases)
  - Focal cortical resection
  - Hemispherectomy
- Rehabilitation services
  - Physical therapy
  - Occupational therapy
  - Speech therapy

### Clinical Trials and Studies
- Ongoing research at major epilepsy centers
- Investigations into genetic therapies
- Studies on novel anticonvulsant treatments
- Exploration of precision medicine approaches
- Resources: ClinicalTrials.gov, epilepsy research networks
