# Dup 15Q

### Disease Overview
Duplication 15q Syndrome (Dup 15q) is a rare neurodevelopmental genetic disorder characterized by the presence of extra genetic material from chromosome 15's q11.2-q13.1 region. This chromosomal abnormality leads to a complex spectrum of developmental, neurological, and behavioral challenges that can significantly impact an individual's quality of life.

### Disease Category
Genetic Chromosomal Disorder
Subtype: Neurodevelopmental Disorder

### Synonyms
- Duplication 15q Syndrome
- Dup15q
- Chromosome 15q11.2-13.1 Duplication Syndrome
- Isodicentric 15
- Idic(15) Syndrome

### Signs & Symptoms
Primary symptoms include:
- Developmental delays
- Intellectual disability
- Autism spectrum disorder
- Hypotonia (low muscle tone)
- Epilepsy/seizure disorders
- Behavioral challenges
- Sleep disturbances
- Potential speech and motor skill impairments
- Possible distinctive facial characteristics

### Causes
Genetic Etiology:
- Isodicentric 15 chromosomes (idic(15)): Two extra copies of chromosome 15 region
- Interstitial duplications of 15q (int dup(15)): One extra copy of the region
- Spontaneous genetic mutation
- Rare inherited transmission

### Affected Populations
- Prevalence: Rare disorder
- Gender: Affects males and females equally
- Age of Onset: Typically identified in early childhood
- No specific racial or ethnic predisposition
