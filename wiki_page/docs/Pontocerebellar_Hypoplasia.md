# Pontocerebellar Hypoplasia

### Disease Overview
Pontocerebellar Hypoplasia (PCH) is a rare, severe neurodegenerative disorder characterized by underdevelopment and degeneration of specific brain regions, primarily the cerebellum and pons. This genetic condition results in profound neurological impairments, typically manifesting in infancy or early childhood, with multiple subtypes presenting varying clinical features and genetic origins.

### Disease Category
Neurological Disorder
- Subcategory: Neurodegenerative Disease
- Specific Classification: Cerebellar Ataxia
- Genetic Disorder

### Synonyms
- PCH
- Pontocerebellar Atrophy
- Developmental Pontocerebellar Hypoplasia

### Signs & Symptoms
- Severe developmental delay
- Profound intellectual disability
- Muscle weakness and hypotonia
- Ataxia (impaired coordination)
- Seizure disorders
- Microcephaly
- Spasticity
- Feeding and swallowing difficulties
- Respiratory complications
- Potential visual and hearing impairments

### Causes
Genetic Mutations:
- Autosomal recessive inheritance pattern
- Known causative genes:
  - TSEN2, TSEN34, TSEN54 (PCH2 and PCH4)
  - EXOSC3 (PCH1)
  - RARS2 (PCH6)
  - VRK1
  - AMPD2
