# CHARGE Syndrome

### Disease Overview
CHARGE Syndrome is a complex genetic disorder characterized by multiple congenital anomalies affecting various organ systems. The acronym CHARGE represents key features of the syndrome: Coloboma, Heart defects, Atresia choanae, Restricted growth and development, Genital abnormalities, and Ear abnormalities. These characteristics can vary significantly in severity and presentation among affected individuals.

### Disease Category
Genetic Disorder / Congenital Malformation Syndrome

### Synonyms
- CHARGE Association
- Hall-Hittner Syndrome

### Signs & Symptoms
Key clinical manifestations include:
- Coloboma (eye defect)
- Congenital heart defects
- Choanal atresia (nasal passage blockage)
- Developmental and growth delays
- Feeding difficulties
- Genital abnormalities
- Ear malformations and hearing loss
- Cranial nerve dysfunction
- Facial asymmetry
- Intellectual disabilities
- Balance and coordination challenges
- Respiratory complications
- Endocrine system irregularities

### Causes
Primary Cause:
- Mutations in the CHD7 gene (located on chromosome 8q12.1)
- Autosomal dominant inheritance pattern
- Typically occurs as a spontaneous (de novo) mutation

Genetic Mechanism:
- Disrupts chromatin remodeling
- Impairs gene expression regulation
- Interferes with embryonic development across multiple organ systems

### Affected Populations
- Prevalence: 1 in 8,500 to 1 in 15,000 live births
- Equal gender distribution
- Predominantly sporadic occurrence
- No specific racial or ethnic predisposition

### Disorders with Similar Symptoms
- VACTERL association
- DiGeorge Syndrome
- Kallmann Syndrome
- Treacher Collins Syndrome
- Branchio-oto-renal syndrome (BOR)

### Diagnosis
Diagnostic Criteria:
- Comprehensive clinical evaluation
- Genetic testing for CHD7 gene mutations
- Multidisciplinary specialist assessment
- Imaging studies (echocardiography, ophthalmologic, audiologic)
- Genetic counseling

### Standard Therapies
Multidisciplinary Treatment Approach:
- Surgical interventions
- Hearing rehabilitation
- Speech and language therapy
- Developmental support
- Specialized educational programs
- Hormone replacement therapy
- Regular monitoring by specialist team

### Clinical Trials and Studies
Current Research Focus:
- Genetic mechanisms
- Potential therapeutic interventions
- Long-term outcome studies
- Advanced diagnostic techniques

Resources for Clinical Trials:
- ClinicalTrials.gov
- NIH Clinical Trials Registry
- Rare Disease Clinical Research Network
