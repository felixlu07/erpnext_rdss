# Pallister-Killian Syndrome

### Disease Overview
Pallister-Killian Syndrome (PKS) is a rare chromosomal disorder characterized by mosaic tetrasomy 12p, resulting in a complex pattern of developmental and physical abnormalities. The condition is caused by the presence of an extra isochromosome 12p in some cells of the body, leading to significant genetic variation and unique clinical manifestations.

### Disease Category
Rare Genetic Chromosomal Disorder
- Chromosomal Mosaicism
- Numerical Chromosomal Abnormality

### Synonyms
- Tetrasomy 12p Mosaicism
- Mosaic Tetrasomy 12p Syndrome
- Pallister Mosaic Syndrome
- PKS

### Signs & Symptoms
Primary clinical features include:
Physical Characteristics:
- Distinctive facial features (high forehead, broad flat nose)
- Sparse scalp hair
- Short neck
- Skin pigmentation anomalies
- Potential polydactyly (extra fingers/toes)

Neurological/Developmental:
- Severe intellectual disability
- Developmental delays
- Hypotonia (low muscle tone)
- Seizures

Additional Medical Complications:
- Congenital heart defects
- Hearing impairment
- Vision problems
- Skeletal abnormalities

### Causes
Genetic Mechanism:
- Spontaneous chromosomal mutation
- Formation of an extra isochromosome 12p
- Occurs randomly during early embryonic cell division
- Not typically inherited from parents
- Mosaic pattern means not all body cells are affected equally

### Affected Populations
- Extremely rare disorder
- No gender predilection
- No specific ethnic predominance
- Estimated prevalence: Less than 1 in 100,000 live births
- Most cases are sporadic (occur randomly)

### Disorders with Similar Symptoms
- Down Syndrome
- Smith-Magenis Syndrome
- Angelman Syndrome
- Prader-Willi Syndrome
- Chromosomal mosaicism disorders

### Diagnosis
Diagnostic Methods:
- Comprehensive chromosomal analysis
- Karyotyping
- Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)
- Chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA)
- Prenatal genetic testing
- Detailed clinical evaluation

### Standard Therapies
Multidisciplinary Management:
- Early intervention programs
- Special education support
- Physical therapy
- Occupational therapy
- Speech therapy
- Seizure management
- Cardiac monitoring
- Hearing and vision assessments
- Genetic counseling

### Clinical Trials and Studies
- Limited research due to rarity of condition
- Ongoing genetic research
- Recommended consultation with specialized genetic centers
