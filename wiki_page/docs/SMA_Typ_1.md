# SMA Type 1

### Disease Overview
Spinal Muscular Atrophy Type 1 (SMA Type 1) is a severe genetic neuromuscular disorder characterized by progressive muscle weakness and motor neuron loss, typically affecting infants. It is the most severe form of spinal muscular atrophy, with significant impact on muscle function and survival.

### Disease Category
Neuromuscular Disorder, Genetic Disorder, Autosomal Recessive Condition

### Synonyms
- Werdnig-Hoffmann disease
- SMA Type I
- Infantile-onset SMA
- Proximal Spinal Muscular Atrophy Type 1

### Signs & Symptoms
- Severe muscle weakness
- Poor muscle tone (hypotonia)
- Lack of motor development
- Difficulty breathing and feeding
- Tongue fasciculations (twitching)
- Scoliosis (curvature of the spine)
- Respiratory insufficiency
- Weak cry
- Limited head and neck movement
- Potential cardiac complications

### Causes
- Genetic mutation in the SMN1 gene (chromosome 5q)
- Insufficient production of survival motor neuron (SMN) protein
- Autosomal recessive inheritance pattern
- Complete or near-complete loss of functional SMN protein

### Affected Populations
- Incidence: 1 in 6,000 to 1 in 10,000 live births
- Affects all ethnic groups
- Equal gender distribution
- Most severe in infants under 6 months
- Leading genetic cause of infant mortality

### Disorders with Similar Symptoms
- Congenital myopathies
- Congenital muscular dystrophy
- Myasthenia gravis
- Glycogen storage diseases
- Infantile botulism
- Peripheral neuropathies

### Diagnosis
- Genetic testing for SMN1 gene mutations
- Electromyography (EMG)
- Muscle biopsy
- Comprehensive neurological examination
- Genetic counseling
- Prenatal and newborn screening
- Creatine kinase (CK) level testing

### Standard Therapies
- Medication:
  - Nusinersen (Spinraza)
  - Onasemnogene abeparvovec-xioi (Zolgensma)
  - Risdiplam (Evrysdi)

- Supportive Care:
  - Respiratory support
  - Nutritional interventions
  - Physical therapy
  - Occupational therapy
  - Assistive devices
  - Ventilation support

### Clinical Trials and Studies
- Ongoing research in gene therapy
- Stem cell treatments
- Novel drug development
- Combination therapy investigations
- Long-term outcome studies

Spinal Muscular Atrophy Type 1 is a devastating genetic disorder affecting infants, characterized by progressive muscle weakness due to motor neuron loss. With advances in genetic therapies and supportive care, management strategies continue to improve, offering hope for enhanced quality of life and potential treatment breakthroughs.
