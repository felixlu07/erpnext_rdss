# NACC1 Gene Mutation

### Disease Overview
NACC1 (Nucleus Accumbens Associated 1) is a gene critical for neurological development and cellular function. Mutations in this gene can lead to a rare neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by significant neurological and developmental challenges. The gene plays a crucial role in transcriptional regulation and cellular growth, with mutations potentially disrupting normal neural development and function.

### Disease Category
Rare Neurodevelopmental Genetic Disorder

### Synonyms
- NACC1-Related Neurodevelopmental Disorder
- Nucleus Accumbens Associated 1 Gene Mutation Syndrome
- NACC1 Genetic Disorder

### Signs & Symptoms
Primary clinical manifestations include:
- Intellectual disability (mild to severe)
- Global developmental delay
- Expressive and receptive language delays
- Motor skill impairments
- Neurological complications:
  - Seizures
  - Hypotonia (decreased muscle tone)
- Behavioral challenges:
  - Autism spectrum-like behaviors
  - Attention deficits
  - Hyperactivity
- Potential cognitive processing difficulties
- Potential sensory integration challenges

### Causes
- Genetic mutations in the NACC1 gene
- Typically occurs through:
  - Spontaneous (de novo) mutations
  - Rare inherited patterns
- Disrupts protein function critical for neural development
- Impacts cellular communication and neurological pathway formation

### Affected Populations
- Estimated prevalence: Extremely rare
- No significant gender predilection
- Can affect individuals across all ethnic backgrounds
- Typically identified in early childhood
- No known geographic concentration
