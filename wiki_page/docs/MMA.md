# MMA

### Disease Overview
Methylmalonic Acidemia (MMA) is a rare, inherited metabolic disorder characterized by the body's inability to properly break down certain proteins and fats. This genetic condition results in the accumulation of methylmalonic acid in blood and tissues, potentially causing severe metabolic complications and significant health challenges.

### Disease Category
- Rare Genetic Disorder
- Metabolic Disorder
- Inborn Error of Metabolism

### Synonyms
- Methylmalonic Aciduria
- MMA
- Methylmalonic Acidemia
- Cobalamin Metabolism Disorder

### Signs & Symptoms
Acute and Chronic Symptoms:
- Metabolic Crisis Symptoms:
  - Severe vomiting
  - Dehydration
  - Lethargy
  - Hypotonia (low muscle tone)
  - Seizures

- Developmental Complications:
  - Developmental delays
  - Intellectual disabilities
  - Growth retardation

- Organ-Specific Complications:
  - Chronic kidney disease
  - Enlarged liver (hepatomegaly)
  - Pancreatitis
  - Cardiomyopathy
  - Neurological impairment

### Causes
Genetic Mutations:
- Primary Genetic Causes:
  - Mutations in MUT gene
  - Mutations in MMAA gene
  - Mutations in MMAB gene
  - Mutations in MMADHC gene

- Underlying Mechanism:
  - Deficiency of methylmalonyl-CoA mutase enzyme
  - Impaired metabolism of specific amino acids and fatty acids
  - Accumulation of toxic metabolites

### Affected Populations
- Prevalence: Approximately 1 in 50,000 to 1 in 100,000 live births
- Inheritance Pattern: Autosomal recessive
- Affects all genders and ethnic backgrounds
- Typically diagnosed in infancy or early childhood

### Disorders with Similar Symptoms
- Propionic Acidemia
- Isovaleric Acidemia
- Maple Syrup Urine Disease
- Multiple Carboxylase Deficiency
- Organic Acidurias

### Diagnosis
Diagnostic Methods:
- Newborn screening
- Blood and urine organic acid analysis
- Genetic testing
- Enzyme activity assays
- Metabolic screening
- Clinical evaluation

### Standard Therapies
- Dietary Management:
  - Protein-restricted diet
  - Low intake of methionine, threonine, valine, isoleucine
  - Specialized metabolic formulas

- Pharmacological Interventions:
  - High-dose Vitamin B12 supplementation
  - Carnitine supplements
  - Metronidazole
  - Antibiotics during metabolic crises

- Advanced Interventions:
  - Liver transplantation
  - Kidney transplantation
  - Stem cell therapy (experimental)

### Clinical Trials and Studies
- Ongoing research in gene therapy
- Investigating novel metabolic treatments
- Exploring enzyme replacement strategies
- Long-term outcome studies
