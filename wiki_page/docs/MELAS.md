# MELAS

### Disease Overview
MELAS (Mitochondrial Encephalomyopathy, Lactic Acidosis, and Stroke-like episodes) is a rare, progressive genetic disorder characterized by mitochondrial dysfunction. It primarily affects the nervous system and muscles, causing significant neurological and metabolic complications. The disorder is part of a group of mitochondrial diseases that impair the body's ability to generate energy at the cellular level.

### Disease Category
Mitochondrial Genetic Disorder
Neurometabolic Disorder

### Synonyms
- MELAS syndrome
- Mitochondrial Myopathy, Encephalopathy, Lactic Acidosis, and Stroke-like episodes
- Mitochondrial Encephalomyopathy with Lactic Acidosis

### Signs & Symptoms
- Stroke-like episodes (typically before age 40)
- Seizures
- Recurrent headaches or migraines
- Progressive muscle weakness
- Exercise intolerance
- Hearing loss
- Vision problems
- Diabetes mellitus
- Cardiac issues (cardiomyopathy)
- Lactic acidosis
- Developmental delays
- Cognitive impairment
- Gastrointestinal problems
- Short stature

### Causes
- Genetic mutations in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)
- Primary mutation in the MT-TL1 gene (most common)
- Other possible mutations in MT-ND1, MT-ND5, and MT-TH genes
- Inherited through maternal transmission
- Affects mitochondrial protein synthesis and energy production

### Affected Populations
- Rare disorder affecting approximately 1 in 4,000 to 1 in 8,000 individuals
- Can occur at any age, but typically begins in childhood or early adulthood
- No significant gender predilection
- Affects all ethnic groups

### Disorders with Similar Symptoms
- Leigh syndrome
- MERRF syndrome
- Mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalopathy
- Other mitochondrial disorders
- Epilepsy
- Multiple sclerosis
- Muscular dystrophy

### Diagnosis
- Comprehensive clinical evaluation
- Detailed family medical history
- Muscle biopsy (revealing "ragged red fibers")
- Neuroimaging (MRI, CT scans)
- Genetic testing for mtDNA mutations
- Blood and cerebrospinal fluid lactate levels
- Electroencephalogram (EEG)
- Electromyography (EMG)

### Standard Therapies
- No definitive cure
- Symptomatic and supportive treatment
- Anticonvulsant medications
- Physical therapy
- Nutritional supplements
- Coenzyme Q10
- L-carnitine
- Vitamin B complex
- Management of associated conditions
- Genetic counseling

### Complete Report
MELAS is a complex mitochondrial disorder with significant neurological and metabolic implications. While current treatments focus on managing symptoms, ongoing research offers hope for more targeted therapies in the future. Comprehensive care requires a multidisciplinary approach involving neurologists, geneticists, and other specialists.
