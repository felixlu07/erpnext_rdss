# Pompe Disease (LOPD)

### Disease Overview
Pompe Disease is a rare, inherited metabolic disorder characterized by the progressive accumulation of glycogen in cells due to a deficiency of the enzyme acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA). Late-Onset Pompe Disease (LOPD) typically manifests in childhood, adolescence, or adulthood, causing progressive muscle weakness and respiratory complications.

### Disease Category
- Genetic Disorder
- Metabolic Disorder
- Neuromuscular Disorder
- Lysosomal Storage Disease

### Synonyms
- Glycogen Storage Disease Type II
- Acid Maltase Deficiency
- Glycogenosis Type II
- Alpha-1,4-Glucosidase Deficiency

### Signs & Symptoms
- Progressive muscle weakness, particularly in legs and trunk
- Respiratory insufficiency
- Difficulty walking, running, or climbing stairs
- Chronic fatigue
- Muscle pain and cramps
- Potential cardiac involvement
- Respiratory muscle weakness
- Sleep apnea
- Reduced exercise tolerance

### Causes
- Autosomal recessive genetic inheritance
- Mutations in the GAA gene on chromosome 17
- Deficiency or dysfunction of acid alpha-glucosidase enzyme
- Impaired glycogen breakdown in lysosomal cells
- Accumulation of glycogen in muscle tissues

### Affected Populations
- Prevalence: Approximately 1 in 40,000 individuals globally
- Affects both males and females
- Occurs across various ethnic groups
- Symptoms typically emerge in childhood or adulthood
- No significant geographical or racial predisposition

### Disorders with Similar Symptoms
- Other Glycogen Storage Diseases
- Muscular Dystrophies
- Polymyositis
- Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)
- Metabolic Myopathies
- Mitochondrial Disorders

### Diagnosis
- Comprehensive clinical evaluation
- Enzyme activity assay
- Genetic testing for GAA gene mutations
- Muscle biopsy
- Electromyography (EMG)
- Pulmonary function testing
- Creatine kinase level assessment
- Genetic counseling

### Standard Therapies
- Enzyme Replacement Therapy (ERT)
- Respiratory support interventions
- Physical therapy
- Occupational therapy
- Nutritional counseling
- Assistive devices
- Ventilatory support
- Regular monitoring of cardiac and respiratory functions

### Clinical Trials and Studies
- Ongoing research into:
  - Gene therapy
  - Advanced enzyme replacement techniques
  - Novel therapeutic approaches
  - Long-term treatment strategies
- Registered clinical trials available on ClinicalTrials.gov

Pompe Disease represents a complex genetic disorder requiring comprehensive, multidisciplinary management. While current treatments focus on symptom management and enzyme replacement, ongoing research offers hope for more advanced therapeutic interventions. Patients benefit from early diagnosis, personalized treatment plans, and comprehensive support systems.
