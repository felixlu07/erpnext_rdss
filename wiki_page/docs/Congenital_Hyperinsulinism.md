# Congenital Hyperinsulinism

### Disease Overview
Congenital Hyperinsulinism (CHI) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by uncontrolled insulin secretion from pancreatic beta cells, resulting in persistent and potentially dangerous hypoglycemia. This condition can cause significant neurological complications if not promptly diagnosed and managed, potentially leading to permanent brain damage.

### Disease Category
Rare Genetic Endocrine and Metabolic Disorder

### Synonyms
- Persistent Hyperinsulinemic Hypoglycemia of Infancy (PHHI)
- Nesidioblastosis
- Pancreatic Nesidioblastosis
- Familial Hyperinsulinism

### Signs & Symptoms
- Severe and recurrent hypoglycemia in newborns and infants
- Neurological symptoms during hypoglycemic episodes:
  - Jitteriness
  - Lethargy
  - Irritability
  - Poor feeding
  - Seizures
  - Potential loss of consciousness
- Risk of developmental delays
- Potential long-term neurological impairment
- Sweating
- Pallor
- Weakness
- Altered mental status

### Causes
Genetic Mutations Affecting Insulin Regulation:
- Primary genetic mutations in:
  - ABCC8 gene
  - KCNJ11 gene
  - GLUD1 gene
  - GCK gene
  - HADH gene
  - HNF4A gene
  - UCP2 gene

Disease Forms:
- Diffuse form: Insulin overproduction throughout pancreas
- Focal form: Localized insulin-producing area in pancreas
- Autosomal recessive inheritance pattern

### Affected Populations
- Primarily affects neonates and infants
- Equal gender distribution
- Higher incidence in populations with:
  - High consanguinity rates
  - Ashkenazi Jewish descent
  - Saudi Arabian descent
- Estimated prevalence: 1 in 50,000 live births

### Disorders with Similar Symptoms
- Insulinoma
- Congenital Glycosylation Disorders
- Ketotic Hypoglycemia
- Addison's Disease
- Other metabolic disorders causing hypoglycemia

### Diagnosis
Diagnostic Criteria:
- Blood glucose levels below 50-60 mg/dL
- Inappropriately high insulin levels during hypoglycemia
- Genetic testing for mutation identification
- Imaging studies:
  - CT scan
  - MRI
  - Positron Emission Tomography
- Potential pancreatic biopsy
- Comprehensive metabolic panel
- Hormone level assessments

### Standard Therapies
Medical Management:
- Intravenous glucose administration
- Medications:
  - Diazoxide
  - Octreotide (somatostatin analog)
  - Nifedipine
- Frequent feeding protocols
- Continuous glucose monitoring

Surgical Interventions:
- Partial pancreatectomy
- Near-total pancreatectomy
- Selective adenoma removal (in focal cases)

### Clinical Trials and Studies
- Ongoing genetic research
- Novel medication development
- Surgical technique improvements
- Gene therapy investigations
- Recommended resources:
  - ClinicalTrials.gov
  - NIH Clinical Trials Registry
