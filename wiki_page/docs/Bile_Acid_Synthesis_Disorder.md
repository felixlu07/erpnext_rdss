# Bile Acid Synthesis Disorder

### Disease Overview
Bile Acid Synthesis Disorder (BASD) is a rare group of inherited metabolic disorders characterized by genetic defects in the enzymatic pathway responsible for bile acid production. These disorders disrupt the body's ability to synthesize bile acids properly, leading to significant metabolic and hepatic complications. Bile acids are crucial for fat digestion, nutrient absorption, and cholesterol elimination.

### Disease Category
- Metabolic Genetic Disorder
- Rare Inherited Metabolic Disease
- Congenital Metabolic Disorder
- Hepatic Metabolic Disorder

### Synonyms
- Congenital Bile Acid Synthesis Deficiency
- Bile Acid Synthetic Enzyme Defect
- Inherited Bile Acid Metabolism Disorder

### Signs & Symptoms
Primary symptoms include:
- Jaundice
- Hepatomegaly (enlarged liver)
- Chronic cholestasis
- Growth failure
- Fat malabsorption
- Vitamin deficiencies (A, D, E, K)
- Persistent itching (pruritus)
- Pale or clay-colored stools
- Developmental delays
- Potential progressive liver disease

### Causes
Genetic mutations in enzymes involved in bile acid synthesis, including:
- CYP7A1 gene
- CYP27A1 gene
- HSD3B7 gene
- AKR1D1 gene
- SRD5B1 gene

Inheritance is typically autosomal recessive, requiring both parents to carry a mutated gene.

### Affected Populations
- Estimated prevalence: Extremely rare
- Affects all ethnic groups
- Typically diagnosed in infancy or early childhood
- No significant gender predilection

### Disorders with Similar Symptoms
- Neonatal hepatitis
- Alagille syndrome
- Progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis
- Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency
- Biliary atresia
- Wilson disease

### Diagnosis
Diagnostic approach includes:
- Comprehensive medical history
- Physical examination
- Specialized bile acid metabolite testing
- Genetic testing
- Liver function tests
- Serum cholesterol and triglyceride analysis
- Liver biopsy
- Metabolic screening

### Standard Therapies
- Oral bile acid replacement therapy
- Specific bile acid supplementation
- Fat-soluble vitamin supplementation
- Nutritional management
- Potential liver transplantation in severe cases
- Symptomatic and supportive care

### Clinical Trials and Studies
- Limited ongoing clinical trials
- Research focused on:
  - Gene therapy
  - Enzyme replacement strategies
  - Long-term metabolic management
