# Cardiofaciocutaneous Syndrome

### Disease Overview
Cardiofaciocutaneous (CFC) syndrome is a rare genetic disorder characterized by distinctive physical abnormalities and developmental challenges. It is part of the RASopathies, a group of conditions caused by mutations affecting the RAS-MAPK cellular signaling pathway, which impacts cell growth, division, and differentiation.

### Disease Category
- Rare genetic disorder
- Congenital condition
- Neurodevelopmental syndrome
- RASopathy

### Synonyms
- CFC Syndrome
- Cardiofaciocutaneous Syndrome
- CFC Syndrome type 1
- CFC Syndrome type 2

### Signs & Symptoms
Key manifestations include:

Cardiac Abnormalities:
- Congenital heart defects
- Atrial septal defects (ASD)
- Ventricular septal defects (VSD)
- Pulmonary stenosis
- Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy

Facial Features:
- High forehead
- Macrocephaly
- Bitemporal narrowing
- Ptosis (drooping eyelids)
- Low-set ears
- Distinctive facial characteristics

Cutaneous Manifestations:
- Dry, thick, scaly skin
- Ichthyosis
- Keratosis pilaris
- Sparse hair
- Absent or minimal eyebrows

Neurological/Developmental:
- Developmental delays
- Intellectual disability
- Hypotonia
- Feeding difficulties
- Potential seizures
- Growth delays

### Causes
Genetic Mutations:
- BRAF gene (most common)
- MAP2K1 gene
- MAP2K2 gene
- KRAS gene

Pathogenesis involves disrupted RAS-MAPK signaling pathway, leading to abnormal cellular development and function.

### Affected Populations
- Prevalence: Extremely rare
- Incidence: Approximately 1 in 810,000 live births
- No significant gender predilection
- Occurs across all ethnic backgrounds

### Disorders with Similar Symptoms
- Noonan Syndrome
- Costello Syndrome
- LEOPARD Syndrome
- Neurofibromatosis type 1
- Other RASopathies

### Diagnosis
Diagnostic Approach:
- Comprehensive clinical evaluation
- Detailed family history
- Physical examination
- Genetic testing for specific mutations
- Cardiac imaging (echocardiogram)
- Neurological assessment
- Dermatological examination

### Standard Therapies
Multidisciplinary Management:
- Cardiac monitoring and intervention
- Early developmental interventions
- Physical therapy
- Occupational therapy
- Speech therapy
- Nutritional support
- Specialized skincare
- Symptomatic treatment of specific complications

### Clinical Trials and Studies
Research Platforms:
- ClinicalTrials.gov
- National Institutes of Health (NIH)
- Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network
- International RASopathies research collaborations
