# CCHS

### Disease Overview
Congenital Central Hypoventilation Syndrome (CCHS) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by the failure of the autonomic nervous system to control breathing, particularly during sleep. Patients experience inadequate respiratory function that can be life-threatening without proper medical intervention.

### Disease Category
Genetic Respiratory Disorder
Neurological Condition
Autonomic Nervous System Disorder

### Synonyms
- Ondine's Curse
- PHOX2B-Related Disorder
- Congenital Central Hypoventilation Syndrome

### Signs & Symptoms
- Hypoventilation, especially during sleep
- Cyanosis (bluish skin discoloration)
- Reduced respiratory drive
- Morning headaches
- Excessive daytime sleepiness
- Neurocognitive deficits
- Cardiovascular abnormalities
- Hirschsprung disease
- Autonomic nervous system dysfunction
- Potential neural crest cell-related tumors

### Causes
- Mutations in the PHOX2B gene (90% of cases)
- Autosomal dominant inheritance pattern
- Disruption of autonomic nervous system development
- Impaired neural crest cell migration and differentiation

### Affected Populations
- Rare disorder affecting approximately 1 in 200,000 live births
- Equal prevalence in males and females
- Occurs across all ethnic groups
- Typically diagnosed at birth or early infancy

### Disorders with Similar Symptoms
- Central sleep apnea
- Congenital diaphragmatic hernia
- Severe brain stem injuries
- Neuromuscular respiratory disorders
- Brainstem malformations

### Diagnosis
- Comprehensive clinical evaluation
- Genetic testing for PHOX2B mutations
- Polysomnography (sleep study)
- Continuous oxygen saturation monitoring
- Neurological assessments
- Genetic counseling

### Standard Therapies
- Mechanical ventilation
- Diaphragm pacing
- Tracheostomy
- Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)
- Multidisciplinary medical management
- Regular neurological and respiratory monitoring
- Potential surgical interventions for associated conditions

### Clinical Trials and Studies
- Ongoing research into gene therapy
- Studies exploring neural crest cell development
- Investigations into long-term management strategies
- Genetic modification research

### Complete Report
Congenital Central Hypoventilation Syndrome is a complex genetic disorder requiring lifelong medical management. Comprehensive care involves respiratory support, genetic counseling, and multidisciplinary medical approaches to ensure patient quality of life and survival.

Patients and families should work closely with specialized medical teams experienced in managing this rare condition, focusing on individualized treatment plans and ongoing monitoring.
