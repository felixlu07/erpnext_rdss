# Costello Syndrome

### Disease Overview
Costello Syndrome is a rare genetic disorder characterized by distinctive physical features, developmental delays, intellectual disabilities, and increased risk of certain medical complications. The syndrome affects multiple body systems and is caused by genetic mutations that impact cell growth and development.

### Disease Category
RASopathy - a group of genetic disorders caused by mutations in genes within the RAS/MAPK cellular signaling pathway, which regulate cell growth, division, and differentiation.

### Synonyms
- Facio-cutaneous syndrome (FCS)
- Costello lipodystrophy syndrome
- HRAS-related Costello syndrome

### Signs & Symptoms
Physical and developmental characteristics include:

Developmental Features:
- Intellectual disability
- Delayed motor and speech development
- Global developmental delays

Physical Features:
- Distinctive facial characteristics
  - Coarse facial appearance
  - Large mouth
  - Full lips
  - Thick nasal septum
- Loose, soft skin with deep creases on palms and soles
- Slow growth and short stature

Medical Complications:
- Cardiac issues (cardiomyopathy, arrhythmias)
- Feeding difficulties in infancy
- Skeletal abnormalities (scoliosis)
- Increased tumor risk (both benign and malignant)
- Papillomas
- Hyperflexibility of joints

### Causes
Genetic Mechanism:
- Caused by de novo mutations in the HRAS gene
- Mutations typically occur spontaneously during reproductive cell formation or early embryonic development
- Autosomal dominant inheritance pattern
- Not usually inherited from parents

### Affected Populations
- Prevalence: 1 in 300,000 to 1 in 1.25 million individuals
- Occurs across all ethnic groups
- Equal gender distribution
- Typically identified in early childhood

### Disorders with Similar Symptoms
- Noonan Syndrome
- Cardiofaciocutaneous Syndrome
- Beckwith-Wiedemann Syndrome
- Kabuki Syndrome

### Diagnosis
Diagnostic Approach:
- Comprehensive clinical evaluation
- Detailed physical examination
- Genetic testing to confirm HRAS gene mutation
- Molecular genetic testing
- Cardiac and developmental assessments

### Standard Therapies
Multidisciplinary Management:
- Regular cardiac monitoring
- Surgical interventions for tumors/skeletal issues
- Speech therapy
- Physical therapy
- Occupational therapy
- Nutritional support
- Individualized educational planning

### Clinical Trials and Studies
Current Research Focus:
- Understanding genetic mechanisms
- Developing targeted therapies
- Long-term outcome studies
- Resources: ClinicalTrials.gov, NIH rare disease databases
