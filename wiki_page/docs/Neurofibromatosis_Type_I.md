# Neurofibromatosis Type I

### Disease Overview
Neurofibromatosis Type I (NF1) is a genetic disorder characterized by the development of multiple benign tumors of nerves and skin (neurofibromas) and areas of abnormal pigmentation (café-au-lait spots). It is one of the most common neurological genetic disorders, affecting multiple body systems with variable expression and severity.

### Disease Category
Genetic neurological disorder; classified as a neurocutaneous syndrome (phakomatosis) with autosomal dominant inheritance pattern.

### Synonyms
- Peripheral Neurofibromatosis
- Recklinghausen Disease
- Von Recklinghausen Neurofibromatosis

### Signs & Symptoms
Primary manifestations include:
- Multiple café-au-lait spots
- Axillary and inguinal freckling
- Lisch nodules (iris hamartomas)
- Cutaneous and plexiform neurofibromas
- Skeletal abnormalities (scoliosis, bone dysplasia)
- Neurological complications
- Cognitive and learning difficulties
- Increased risk of certain cancers
- Potential cardiovascular complications
- Potential ophthalmological issues

### Causes
- Genetic mutation in the NF1 gene on chromosome 17
- Mutation affects neurofibromin protein production
- Disrupts cell growth regulation
- 50% of cases occur through spontaneous mutation
- Autosomal dominant inheritance pattern

### Affected Populations
- Prevalence: 1 in 3,000-4,000 live births
- Affects all racial and ethnic groups
- Equal gender distribution
- Can occur in any family background
- Most cases diagnosed before age 10

### Disorders with Similar Symptoms
- Neurofibromatosis Type II (NF2)
- Legius syndrome
- Schwannomatosis
- McCune-Albright syndrome
- Tuberous sclerosis

### Diagnosis
Diagnostic criteria include:
- ≥6 café-au-lait macules
- ≥2 neurofibromas
- Axillary/inguinal freckling
- Optic glioma
- ≥2 Lisch nodules
- Characteristic bone lesions
- First-degree relative with NF1
- Genetic testing confirmation

### Standard Therapies
- Comprehensive multidisciplinary management
- Regular clinical monitoring
- Surgical tumor removal when necessary
- Orthopedic interventions
- Educational support
- Psychological counseling
- Symptomatic treatment
- Pain management strategies

### Clinical Trials and Studies
- Ongoing research into:
  - Targeted molecular therapies
  - Cancer risk management
  - Neurological intervention strategies
- Clinical trials available through:
  - ClinicalTrials.gov
  - National Institutes of Health
