# Methylmalonic Acidemia MMA

### Disease Overview
Methylmalonic Acidemia (MMA) is a rare, inherited metabolic disorder characterized by the body's inability to properly metabolize certain amino acids, proteins, and fats. This genetic condition leads to the accumulation of methylmalonic acid in bodily fluids and tissues, potentially causing severe metabolic complications.

### Disease Category
Metabolic Disorder
- Subtype: Organic Acidemia
- Classification: Inherited Metabolic Disorder

### Synonyms
- Methylmalonic Aciduria
- MMA
- Methylmalonic Acidemia
- Cobalamin Metabolism Disorder

### Signs & Symptoms
Acute and Chronic Symptoms:
- Metabolic Crisis Symptoms
  - Severe vomiting
  - Dehydration
  - Lethargy
  - Metabolic acidosis

- Neurological Symptoms
  - Seizures
  - Developmental delays
  - Intellectual disability
  - Hypotonia (low muscle tone)

- Systemic Symptoms
  - Failure to thrive
  - Hepatomegaly (enlarged liver)
  - Renal failure
  - Cardiomyopathy
  - Growth retardation

### Causes
Genetic Etiology:
- Autosomal recessive inheritance
- Mutations in genes responsible for protein metabolism:
  - MUT gene
  - MMAA gene
  - MMAB gene
  - MMADHC gene
  - MCEE gene

### Affected Populations
- Prevalence: Approximately 1 in 50,000 to 1 in 100,000 live births
- Equally affects males and females
- Higher incidence in populations with increased consanguinity
- Typically diagnosed in infancy or early childhood

### Disorders with Similar Symptoms
- Propionic Acidemia
- Isovaleric Acidemia
- Maple Syrup Urine Disease
- Urea Cycle Disorders
- Phenylketonuria (PKU)
- Glutaric Acidemia Type I and II

### Diagnosis
Diagnostic Approaches:
- Newborn Screening
- Comprehensive Metabolic Panel
- Genetic Testing
- Urine Organic Acid Analysis
- Blood Amino Acid Profiling
- Imaging Studies (MRI/CT)

### Standard Therapies
- Dietary Management
  - Low-protein diet
  - Specialized metabolic formula
- Vitamin B12 Supplementation
- Carnitine Supplementation
- Emergency Metabolic Protocol
- Medications to manage symptoms
- Potential Organ Transplantation (liver/kidney)

### Clinical Trials and Studies
- Ongoing research in:
  - Gene therapy
  - Metabolic pathway interventions
  - Long-term treatment strategies
- Active clinical trials available on ClinicalTrials.gov
