# X-Linked Hypophosphatemia

### Disease Overview
X-Linked Hypophosphatemia (XLH) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by impaired phosphate metabolism, resulting in low blood phosphate levels and abnormal bone development. The condition leads to rickets in children and osteomalacia in adults, causing skeletal deformities and potential growth complications.

### Disease Category
- Genetic disorder
- Metabolic bone disease
- X-linked inherited condition
- Rare genetic disorder

### Synonyms
- X-Linked Vitamin D-Resistant Rickets
- Hypophosphatemic Rickets
- Familial Hypophosphatemic Rickets

### Signs & Symptoms
- Bone pain and muscle weakness
- Bowed legs and short stature
- Delayed growth
- Rickets in children
- Osteomalacia in adults
- Dental abnormalities
- Spontaneous dental abscesses
- Enlarged skull
- Joint pain and stiffness
- Reduced bone mineralization
- Increased risk of fractures

### Causes
- Mutations in the PHEX gene located on the X chromosome
- Dysregulation of phosphate homeostasis
- Increased levels of Fibroblast Growth Factor 23 (FGF23)
- Impaired renal phosphate reabsorption
- Genetic inheritance pattern: X-linked dominant

### Affected Populations
- Prevalence: 1 in 20,000 to 1 in 60,000 live births
- Affects both males and females
- Males typically experience more severe symptoms
- Onset usually occurs in early childhood
- Genetic transmission primarily through maternal inheritance

### Disorders with Similar Symptoms
- Autosomal Dominant Hypophosphatemic Rickets (ADHR)
- Autosomal Recessive Hypophosphatemic Rickets (ARHR)
- Fanconi Syndrome
- Hereditary Hypophosphatemic Rickets with Hypercalciuria (HHRH)
- Tumor-induced osteomalacia

### Diagnosis
- Comprehensive clinical evaluation
- Detailed family medical history
- Biochemical tests
  - Low serum phosphate levels
  - High urinary phosphate excretion
  - Elevated alkaline phosphatase
- Genetic testing for PHEX gene mutations
- Radiographic imaging
- Bone density scans
- Dental examinations

### Standard Therapies
- Oral phosphate supplements
- Active vitamin D derivatives (calcitriol, alfacalcidol)
- Burosumab (monoclonal antibody targeting FGF23)
- Growth hormone therapy
- Orthopedic interventions
- Dental treatments
- Physical therapy
- Nutritional counseling

### Clinical Trials and Studies
- Ongoing research at major medical centers
- Clinicaltrials.gov listings for XLH
- Investigations into novel genetic therapies
- Long-term treatment outcome studies
- Emerging targeted molecular treatments

X-Linked Hypophosphatemia is a complex genetic disorder affecting phosphate metabolism, causing significant skeletal and dental complications. Comprehensive management requires multidisciplinary care, genetic counseling, and ongoing medical monitoring to optimize patient outcomes and quality of life.
