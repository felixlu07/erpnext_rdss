# Mowat-Wilson Syndrome

### Disease Overview
Mowat-Wilson Syndrome (MWS) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by distinctive facial features, intellectual disability, and multiple congenital anomalies. First described by Dr. Richard Mowat and Dr. Meredith Wilson in 1998, the syndrome involves complex developmental challenges affecting multiple body systems.

### Disease Category
Rare genetic disorder; Congenital malformation syndrome; Neurodevelopmental disorder

### Synonyms
- Hirschsprung Disease-Mental Retardation Syndrome
- ZEB2-Related Syndrome
- Mental Retardation and Distinctive Facial Features Syndrome

### Signs & Symptoms
Physical and Developmental Characteristics:
- Distinctive facial features:
  - Wide-set eyes
  - Square face
  - Broad nasal bridge
  - Prominent chin
  - Uplifted ear lobes
- Severe intellectual disability
- Significant developmental delays
- Speech and motor skill impairments

Medical Complications:
- Epilepsy/seizure disorders
- Hirschsprung disease
- Congenital heart defects
- Genitourinary anomalies
- Gastrointestinal problems
- Potential structural brain abnormalities

### Causes
Genetic Etiology:
- Mutations in the ZEB2 gene (chromosomal location 2q22.3)
- Typically de novo mutations (not inherited)
- Affects gene responsible for embryonic tissue development
- Autosomal dominant inheritance pattern

### Affected Populations
- Prevalence: Extremely rare
- Gender Distribution: Equal occurrence in males and females
- Global occurrence across various ethnic groups
- Estimated incidence: Less than 1 in 50,000 live births

### Disorders with Similar Symptoms
- Rett Syndrome
- Down Syndrome
- CHARGE Syndrome
- Cornelia de Lange Syndrome
- Angelman Syndrome

### Diagnosis
Diagnostic Approach:
- Comprehensive clinical evaluation
- Detailed physical examination
- Genetic testing for ZEB2 gene mutations
- Molecular genetic testing
- Potential additional diagnostic imaging
- Multidisciplinary specialist consultation

### Standard Therapies
Comprehensive Management Strategy:
- Surgical interventions for specific anomalies
- Antiepileptic medications
- Developmental therapies:
  - Speech therapy
  - Occupational therapy
  - Physical therapy
- Regular multidisciplinary monitoring
- Individualized educational support

### Clinical Trials and Studies
Current Research Focus:
- Genetic mechanism understanding
- Potential therapeutic interventions
- Long-term developmental outcomes
- Recommended resource: ClinicalTrials.gov
