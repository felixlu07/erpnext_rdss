# Alternating Hemiplegia of Childhood (AHC)

### Disease Overview
Alternating Hemiplegia of Childhood (AHC) is a rare, complex neurological disorder characterized by recurrent, transient episodes of hemiplegia (paralysis on one side of the body) that typically begin in infancy or early childhood. The condition is marked by unpredictable neurological symptoms that can affect motor function, cognitive development, and overall neurological functioning.

### Disease Category
Rare Genetic Neurological Disorder

### Synonyms
- Alternating Cerebral Hemiplegia of Childhood
- Periodic Alternating Hemiplegia
- ATP1A3-Related Neurological Disorder

### Signs & Symptoms
- Recurrent episodes of hemiplegia (unilateral or bilateral paralysis)
- Dystonia and abnormal muscle movements
- Developmental delays and intellectual disabilities
- Paroxysmal neurological disturbances
- Involuntary eye movements (nystagmus)
- Ataxia (impaired coordination)
- Seizures
- Cognitive impairments
- Autonomic nervous system dysfunction
- Episodic changes in body temperature
- Potential learning difficulties

### Causes
- Primarily caused by de novo mutations in the ATP1A3 gene
- Autosomal dominant inheritance pattern
- Affects the sodium-potassium pump (Na+/K+-ATPase) in neurons
- Disrupts normal neuronal function and brain activity
- Genetic mutations lead to impaired ion regulation in nerve cells

### Affected Populations
- Prevalence: Approximately 1 in 1 million births
- Onset: Typically before 18 months of age
- Equal distribution between males and females
- Rare worldwide occurrence
- Most cases are sporadic (not inherited)

### Disorders with Similar Symptoms
- Hemiplegic Migraine
- Epilepsy
- Rett Syndrome
- Mitochondrial Disorders
- Cerebral Palsy
- Paroxysmal Neurological Disorders

### Diagnosis
- Comprehensive clinical evaluation
- Detailed medical history
- Genetic testing for ATP1A3 mutations
- Neurological examinations
- Electroencephalogram (EEG)
- Neuroimaging (MRI, CT scans)
- Exclusion of other neurological conditions
- Genetic counseling

### Standard Therapies
- Symptomatic and supportive care
- Medications:
  - Sodium oxybate
  - Antiepileptic drugs
  - Benzodiazepines
- Rehabilitation therapies:
  - Physical therapy
  - Occupational therapy
  - Speech therapy
- Management of triggers
- Individualized treatment plans
- Psychological support

### Clinical Trials and Studies
- Ongoing research at major neurological research centers
- Focus on:
  - Understanding genetic mechanisms
  - Developing targeted therapies
  - Improving symptom management
- Recommended resources:
  - ClinicalTrials.gov
  - National Institutes of Health (NIH)
  - International AHC research collaborations
