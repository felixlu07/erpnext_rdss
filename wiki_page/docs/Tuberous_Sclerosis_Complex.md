# Tuberous Sclerosis Complex

### Disease Overview
Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by the growth of numerous benign tumors (hamartomas) in multiple organ systems, including the brain, skin, kidneys, heart, and lungs. The condition is typically lifelong and can cause significant medical and developmental challenges.

### Disease Category
Genetic disorder, neurocutaneous syndrome, multisystem hamartoma syndrome

### Synonyms
- Tuberous Sclerosis
- Bourneville Disease
- Epiloia
- Tuberous Sclerosis Syndrome

### Signs & Symptoms
- Cutaneous manifestations:
  - Facial angiofibromas
  - Hypomelanotic macules
  - Shagreen patches
  - Ungual fibromas

- Neurological symptoms:
  - Seizures
  - Developmental delays
  - Intellectual disabilities
  - Autism spectrum disorders
  - Behavioral problems (ADHD)

- Organ-specific manifestations:
  - Renal angiomyolipomas
  - Pulmonary lymphangioleiomyomatosis
  - Cardiac rhabdomyomas
  - Retinal hamartomas
  - Dental enamel pits

### Causes
Genetic mutations in either:
- TSC1 gene (located on chromosome 9)
- TSC2 gene (located on chromosome 16)

These mutations disrupt the mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) signaling pathway, leading to uncontrolled cell growth and tumor formation. Approximately 70-80% of cases are caused by de novo mutations, while 20-30% are inherited.

### Affected Populations
- Incidence: 1 in 6,000 live births
- Prevalence: Approximately 1 in 20,000 individuals
- Affects all ethnic groups and genders equally
- Can occur in any age group, often diagnosed in childhood

### Disorders with Similar Symptoms
- Neurofibromatosis
- Sturge-Weber Syndrome
- Von Hippel-Lindau Disease
- Proteus Syndrome
- PTEN Hamartoma Syndrome

### Diagnosis
Diagnostic criteria include:
- Clinical examination
- Genetic testing for TSC1/TSC2 mutations
- Imaging studies:
  - MRI (brain)
  - CT scans
  - Ultrasound
- EEG for seizure evaluation
- Ophthalmologic and dermatologic assessments

### Standard Therapies
- Symptomatic management
- Antiepileptic medications
- mTOR inhibitors (Everolimus, Sirolimus)
- Surgical interventions for symptomatic tumors
- Behavioral and educational support
- Multidisciplinary care approach

### Clinical Trials and Studies
Active research areas:
- mTOR inhibitor effectiveness
- Targeted molecular therapies
- Neurological and behavioral interventions
- Long-term management strategies

### Complete Report
A comprehensive genetic disorder characterized by widespread benign tumor formation, TSC presents complex medical challenges requiring lifelong multidisciplinary management. Genetic mutations disrupt cellular growth regulation, leading to diverse systemic manifestations. Ongoing research focuses on targeted therapies and improved understanding of the disorder's molecular mechanisms.
