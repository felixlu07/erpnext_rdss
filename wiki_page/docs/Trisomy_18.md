# Trisomy 18

### Disease Overview
Trisomy 18, also known as Edwards syndrome, is a serious genetic chromosomal disorder characterized by the presence of an extra chromosome 18. This additional genetic material causes significant developmental and medical complications, resulting in profound intellectual disability and multiple congenital anomalies. Most affected individuals experience severe health challenges and have a significantly reduced life expectancy.

### Disease Category
Chromosomal Disorder, Genetic Condition

### Synonyms
- Edwards syndrome
- Trisomy E
- Chromosome 18 Trisomy Syndrome

### Signs & Symptoms
Physical and Developmental Characteristics:
- Severe intellectual disability
- Significant growth deficiencies
- Craniofacial abnormalities
- Clenched hands with overlapping fingers
- Rocker-bottom feet
- Low-set ears
- Small jaw (micrognathia)
- Small head circumference (microcephaly)

Medical Complications:
- Congenital heart defects
- Kidney abnormalities
- Respiratory insufficiency
- Muscle tone abnormalities
- Underdeveloped lungs
- Feeding difficulties
- Seizures
- Structural brain malformations

### Causes
Genetic Mechanism:
- Random error in cell division (nondisjunction)
- Extra copy of chromosome 18 in all or some cells
- Typically occurs spontaneously
- Not usually inherited
- Increased risk with advanced maternal age

### Affected Populations
- Incidence: 1 in 5,000 to 1 in 7,000 live births
- More common in females (female-to-male ratio approximately 3:1)
- Affects all racial and ethnic groups
- Majority of affected pregnancies result in miscarriage or stillbirth

### Disorders with Similar Symptoms
- Trisomy 13 (Patau syndrome)
- Trisomy 21 (Down syndrome)
- Turner syndrome
- Other chromosomal abnormalities

### Diagnosis
Prenatal Diagnostic Methods:
- Detailed ultrasound screening
- Maternal serum screening
- Amniocentesis
- Chorionic villus sampling (CVS)
- Non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT)

Postnatal Diagnostic Confirmation:
- Clinical examination
- Genetic karyotyping
- Chromosomal microarray analysis

### Standard Therapies
Treatment Approach:
- No definitive cure
- Multidisciplinary supportive care
- Individualized medical management
- Symptomatic and palliative interventions

Potential Interventions:
- Surgical corrections for congenital abnormalities
- Respiratory support
- Nutritional management
- Physical and occupational therapy
- Management of cardiac and renal complications

### Clinical Trials and Studies
- Ongoing research into genetic mechanisms
- Studies exploring potential therapeutic interventions
- Investigations into long-term outcomes and care strategies

### Complete Report
Trisomy 18 represents a complex chromosomal disorder with significant medical and developmental challenges. While the prognosis remains guarded, advances in medical care and supportive interventions continue to improve understanding and management of this condition.
