# Floating Harbour Syndrome

### Disease Overview
Floating Harbour Syndrome (FHS) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by distinctive physical features, developmental delays, and specific genetic mutations. First described in the early 1970s, the syndrome is named after the Floating Hospital for Children and Harbour General Hospital where initial cases were identified.

### Disease Category
Rare Genetic Disorder
- Chromosomal Condition
- Developmental Syndrome

### Synonyms
- FHS
- Floating-Harbour Syndrome
- SRCAP-Related Developmental Disorder

### Signs & Symptoms
Primary Clinical Features:
- Short stature
- Delayed bone age
- Distinctive craniofacial characteristics:
  - Triangular face
  - Deep-set eyes
  - Broad nasal bridge
  - Wide mouth
  - Thin upper lip
- Speech and language delays
- Potential intellectual developmental variations
- Possible hearing impairments
- Potential gastrointestinal issues
- Possible cardiac and skeletal abnormalities

### Causes
Genetic Etiology:
- Mutations in the SRCAP gene
- Typically de novo (new) mutations
- Autosomal dominant inheritance pattern
- Affects chromatin remodeling and gene expression
- Not typically inherited from parents

### Affected Populations
- Prevalence: Extremely rare
- Approximately 50 confirmed cases worldwide
- Equal gender distribution
- Global geographic representation
- No specific ethnic predisposition

### Disorders with Similar Symptoms
Differential Diagnosis Considerations:
- Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome
- Noonan syndrome
- Silver-Russell syndrome
- Cornelia de Lange syndrome
- 3M syndrome

### Diagnosis
Diagnostic Approach:
- Comprehensive clinical evaluation
- Genetic testing for SRCAP mutation
- Radiographic bone age assessment
- Audiological examinations
- Developmental screening
- Molecular genetic testing

### Standard Therapies
Multidisciplinary Management:
- Individualized treatment plan
- Growth hormone therapy
- Speech and language intervention
- Special education support
- Potential surgical corrections
- Hearing assistance technologies
- Regular multidisciplinary monitoring

### Clinical Trials and Studies
Current Research Focus:
- Genetic mechanism understanding
- Long-term developmental outcomes
- Potential therapeutic interventions
- Comprehensive phenotype characterization
