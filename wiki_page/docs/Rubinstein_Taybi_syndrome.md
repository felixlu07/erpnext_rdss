# Rubinstein Taybi syndrome

### Disease Overview
Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome (RTS) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by distinctive physical features, developmental challenges, and an increased risk of medical complications. The syndrome is marked by broad thumbs and toes, characteristic facial features, and varying degrees of intellectual disability.

### Disease Category
Rare Genetic Disorder
- Chromosomal Disorder
- Congenital Malformation Syndrome

### Synonyms
- Broad Thumb-Hallux Syndrome
- Rubinstein Syndrome
- RTS

### Signs & Symptoms
Physical Characteristics:
- Broad, angulated thumbs and big toes
- Distinctive facial features
  - Beaked nose
  - Downward-slanting eyes
  - High arched palate
  - Prominent ears
- Short stature
- Microcephaly

Developmental and Cognitive Features:
- Intellectual disability (mild to moderate)
- Developmental delays
- Speech and language challenges
- Learning difficulties

Medical Complications:
- Feeding difficulties in infancy
- Increased risk of tumors
- Congenital heart defects
- Respiratory infections
- Hearing and vision problems
- Skeletal abnormalities

### Causes
Genetic Mutations:
- Mutations in the CREBBP gene (most common, ~55% of cases)
- Mutations in the EP300 gene (~5% of cases)
- Sporadic mutations (de novo)

Inheritance Pattern:
- Autosomal dominant
- Most cases occur as new (spontaneous) mutations

### Affected Populations
- Prevalence: 1 in 100,000 to 1 in 125,000 live births
- Affects males and females equally
- No specific racial or ethnic predisposition

### Disorders with Similar Symptoms
- Floating-Harbor syndrome
- Cornelia de Lange syndrome
- Coffin-Siris syndrome
- Dubowitz syndrome
- KBG syndrome

### Diagnosis
Diagnostic Approach:
- Comprehensive clinical evaluation
- Physical examination
- Genetic testing
  - Molecular genetic testing
  - Chromosomal microarray analysis
- Imaging studies (heart, skeletal)
- Developmental assessments

Diagnostic Criteria:
- Characteristic physical features
- Genetic mutation confirmation
- Developmental evaluation

### Standard Therapies
Medical Management:
- Regular medical monitoring
- Treatment of specific medical complications
- Cardiac evaluation
- Hearing and vision screenings

Therapeutic Interventions:
- Early intervention programs
- Physical therapy
- Occupational therapy
- Speech and language therapy
- Educational support
- Behavioral therapy

### Clinical Trials and Studies
- Ongoing research into genetic mechanisms
- Studies exploring potential targeted therapies
- Longitudinal studies tracking developmental outcomes
