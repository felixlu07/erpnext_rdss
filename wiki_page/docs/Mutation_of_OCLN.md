# Mutation of OCLN

### Disease Overview
Mutation of OCLN is a rare genetic disorder characterized by alterations in the OCLN gene, which encodes the occludin protein. These mutations disrupt tight junction formation and cellular barrier function, leading to multisystemic complications affecting neurological, gastrointestinal, and other physiological systems.

### Disease Category
Genetic Disorder; Hereditary Tight Junction Protein Dysfunction

### Synonyms
- Occludin Deficiency
- OCLN Mutation Syndrome
- Occludin-related Cellular Barrier Disorder

### Signs & Symptoms
- Neurological manifestations:
  - Developmental delays
  - Seizure disorders
  - Cognitive impairments
  - Potential intellectual disabilities

- Gastrointestinal complications:
  - Chronic diarrhea
  - Malabsorption syndrome
  - Increased intestinal permeability
  - Inflammatory responses

- Systemic implications:
  - Compromised immune function
  - Potential liver and kidney dysfunction
  - Increased susceptibility to infections
  - Inflammatory conditions

### Causes
- Genetic mutations in the OCLN gene
- Autosomal inheritance pattern
- Disruption of protein structure and function
- Impaired tight junction formation
- Potential spontaneous mutations

### Affected Populations
- Extremely rare disorder
- No specific gender predilection
- Can manifest in infancy or childhood
- Global geographic distribution
- Estimated prevalence: Less than 1:100,000 individuals

### Disorders with Similar Symptoms
- Claudinopathies
- Neurodevelopmental disorders
- Inflammatory bowel diseases
- Primary immunodeficiency syndromes
- Epilepsy spectrum disorders

### Diagnosis
- Comprehensive genetic testing
- Molecular genetic sequencing
- Clinical symptom evaluation
- Neurological assessments
- Intestinal permeability tests
- Tight junction protein analysis
