# Coffin Siris Syndrome

### Disease Overview
Coffin-Siris Syndrome (CSS) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by developmental delays, intellectual disability, distinctive physical anomalies, and specific genetic mutations affecting chromatin remodeling. First described in 1970 by Dr. Grange S. Coffin and Dr. Evelyn Siris, the syndrome presents with a complex array of clinical manifestations.

### Disease Category
