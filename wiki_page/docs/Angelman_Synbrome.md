# Angelman Syndrome

### Disease Overview
Angelman Syndrome (AS) is a complex neurodevelopmental genetic disorder characterized by severe intellectual disability, speech impairment, movement and balance problems, and a distinctive happy and excitable demeanor. The condition significantly impacts neurological development and quality of life.

### Disease Category
Rare Genetic Neurodevelopmental Disorder

### Synonyms
- AS
- Happy Puppet Syndrome (outdated and inappropriate)
- Chromosomal 15q11-q13 Deletion Syndrome

### Signs & Symptoms
- Severe developmental delays
- Minimal to no verbal communication
- Frequent smiling and laughing
- Ataxia (impaired motor coordination)
- Epilepsy/seizures
- Microcephaly
- Sleep disturbances
- Hyperactivity
- Intellectual disability
- Motor skill challenges
- Fascination with water
- Strabismus
- Jerky, puppet-like movements
- Difficulty with fine and gross motor skills

### Causes
Genetic mutations affecting the UBE3A gene on chromosome 15, specifically:
- Maternal chromosome 15q11-q13 deletion
- UBE3A gene mutation
- Paternal uniparental disomy
- Imprinting center defects
- Chromosomal rearrangements

### Affected Populations
- Prevalence: 1 in 12,000 to 20,000 individuals
- Equal gender distribution
- Occurs across all racial and ethnic groups
- Typically identified in early childhood

### Disorders with Similar Symptoms
- Rett Syndrome
- Prader-Willi Syndrome
- Cerebral Palsy
- Autism Spectrum Disorders
- Mowat-Wilson Syndrome

### Diagnosis
Diagnostic approaches include:
- Comprehensive clinical evaluation
- Detailed developmental history
- Genetic testing (chromosomal microarray, DNA methylation analysis)
- Molecular genetic testing for UBE3A mutations
- Electroencephalogram (EEG) to assess seizure patterns
- Neurological examination

### Standard Therapies
Multidisciplinary management:
- Anticonvulsant medications
- Physical therapy
- Occupational therapy
- Speech and communication therapy
- Behavioral interventions
- Assistive communication technologies
- Special education support
- Nutritional counseling
- Adaptive equipment

### Clinical Trials and Studies
Active research areas:
- Gene therapy
- Targeted molecular interventions
- Neurological development studies
- Potential pharmaceutical treatments
- Registries tracking long-term outcomes
