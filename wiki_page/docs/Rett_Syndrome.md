# Rett Syndrome

### Disease Overview
Rett syndrome is a rare genetic neurological and developmental disorder that primarily affects females, characterized by severe cognitive and physical disabilities that emerge after an initial period of normal early development. The disorder results in progressive neurological impairment and significant developmental challenges.

### Disease Category
Rare genetic neurological and developmental disorder

### Synonyms
- RTT
- Autism-dementia-ataxia-loss of purposeful hand use syndrome
- MECP2-related neurodevelopmental disorder

### Signs & Symptoms
- Progressive loss of purposeful hand skills
- Stereotypic hand movements (hand-wringing, washing, clapping)
- Severe speech and language impairment
- Cognitive disabilities
- Seizures and epilepsy
- Slowed physical growth and development
- Abnormal gait and motor skills
- Breathing irregularities (hyperventilation, breath holding)
- Scoliosis
- Sleep disturbances
- Reduced social interaction

### Causes
- Primarily caused by mutations in the MECP2 gene (located on X chromosome)
- Most cases are spontaneous mutations
- Extremely rare inherited cases
- Affects protein production critical for neural development and function
- Almost exclusively affects females due to X-chromosome linked inheritance

### Affected Populations
- Prevalence: 1 in 10,000 to 15,000 female births
- Predominantly affects females
- Males with mutations typically experience more severe symptoms and often do not survive infancy
- Occurs across all racial and ethnic groups

### Disorders with Similar Symptoms
- Autism spectrum disorder
- Angelman syndrome
- Cerebral palsy
- Childhood disintegrative disorder
- Fragile X syndrome

### Diagnosis
- Clinical evaluation of developmental history and symptoms
- Genetic testing for MECP2 gene mutations
- Neurological examination
- Developmental assessments
- Ruling out other similar neurological disorders
- Brain imaging studies
- Electroencephalogram (EEG) to assess seizure activity

### Standard Therapies
- Multidisciplinary supportive care
- Physical therapy
- Occupational therapy
- Speech and communication therapy
- Seizure management with anticonvulsant medications
- Nutritional support
- Assistive communication technologies
- Orthopedic interventions for scoliosis
- Behavioral and psychological support

### Clinical Trials and Studies
- Ongoing research into:
  - Gene therapy
  - Neurological rehabilitation techniques
  - Pharmacological interventions
  - Stem cell therapies
  - Symptom management strategies
