# SMA Type 2

### Disease Overview
Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) Type 2 is a rare genetic neuromuscular disorder characterized by progressive muscle weakness and atrophy due to the degeneration of motor neurons in the spinal cord. This intermediate form of SMA typically manifests between 6 and 18 months of age, causing significant motor function impairment and developmental challenges.

### Disease Category
Neuromuscular Disorder
Genetic Disorder
Autosomal Recessive Condition

### Synonyms
- Intermediate Spinal Muscular Atrophy
- SMA II
- Juvenile Spinal Muscular Atrophy
- Chromosome 5q Spinal Muscular Atrophy

### Signs & Symptoms
- Symptom onset between 6 and 18 months of age
- Progressive muscle weakness, primarily in proximal muscles
- Delayed motor milestones
- Fasciculations (muscle twitches) in the tongue
- Ability to sit independently but difficulty standing or walking
- Respiratory complications
- Scoliosis
- Contractures
- Reduced muscle tone (hypotonia)
- Potential feeding difficulties

### Causes
- Genetic mutation in the SMN1 gene on chromosome 5q
- Reduced production of survival motor neuron (SMN) protein
- Autosomal recessive inheritance pattern
- Requires inheritance of mutated gene from both parents

### Affected Populations
- Incidence: Approximately 1 in 10,000 live births
- Equal prevalence in males and females
- Typically diagnosed in infancy or early childhood
- Affects all ethnic groups

### Disorders with Similar Symptoms
- Muscular Dystrophy
- Congenital Myopathies
- Guillain-Barre Syndrome
- Other forms of Spinal Muscular Atrophy
- Peripheral Neuropathies
- Mitochondrial Disorders

### Diagnosis
- Comprehensive medical history and physical examination
- Genetic testing for SMN1 gene mutations
- Electromyography (EMG)
- Nerve conduction velocity (NCV) tests
- Muscle biopsy (in atypical cases)
- Creatine kinase (CK) level assessment
- Genetic counseling

### Standard Therapies
- Nusinersen (Spinraza): Antisense oligonucleotide therapy
- Onasemnogene abeparvovec (Zolgensma): Gene replacement therapy
- Risdiplam (Evrysdi): Oral SMN2 gene splicing modifier
- Supportive therapies:
  - Physical therapy
  - Occupational therapy
  - Respiratory support
  - Nutritional management
  - Orthopedic interventions
  - Assistive devices

### Clinical Trials and Studies
- Ongoing research into gene therapy
- Exploring novel pharmacological interventions
- Investigating potential combination therapies
- Studying long-term outcomes and treatment efficacy
- Resources: ClinicalTrials.gov
