# Cornelia de Lange Syndrome

### Disease Overview
Cornelia de Lange Syndrome (CdLS) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by distinctive physical features, developmental delays, and intellectual disabilities. The condition affects multiple body systems and can vary significantly in severity from mild to profound manifestations.

### Disease Category
Congenital genetic disorder classified as a chromosomal cohesinopathy, involving mutations in genes responsible for chromosome structure and cell division.

### Synonyms
- CdLS
- Brachmann-de Lange Syndrome
- Amsterdam Dwarfism
- Developmental Delay-Multiple Congenital Anomalies Syndrome

### Signs & Symptoms
Physical Features:
- Distinctive facial characteristics
  - Arched, thick eyebrows
  - Synophrys (joined eyebrows)
  - Long, curled eyelashes
  - Small, upturned nose
  - Thin, downturned lips
- Limb anomalies
  - Shortened or absent forearms
  - Malformed fingers and toes
  - Upper limb reduction defects

Developmental Characteristics:
- Significant growth delays (pre- and postnatal)
- Intellectual disability
- Developmental delays
- Potential autism-like behaviors
- Potential self-injurious behaviors

Medical Complications:
- Gastrointestinal issues (reflux, constipation)
- Hearing and vision problems
- Congenital heart defects
- Seizures
- Respiratory difficulties

### Causes
Genetic Mutations:
- Primary: NIPBL gene mutation (60-65% of cases)
- Secondary mutations in:
  - SMC1A
  - SMC3
  - RAD21
  - HDAC8

Inheritance Pattern:
- Predominantly sporadic mutations
- Autosomal dominant inheritance in some cases
- Rare familial transmission

### Affected Populations
- Prevalence: 1 in 10,000 to 30,000 live births
- Affects all ethnic backgrounds
- Equal gender distribution
- No known geographical predisposition

### Disorders with Similar Symptoms
- Fetal Alcohol Syndrome
- Smith-Lemli-Opitz Syndrome
- Rubinstein-Taybi Syndrome
- Coffin-Siris Syndrome

### Diagnosis
Diagnostic Methods:
- Comprehensive clinical evaluation
- Physical characteristic assessment
- Genetic testing
- Molecular genetic analysis
- Chromosomal microarray
- Whole exome sequencing

### Standard Therapies
Multidisciplinary Management:
- Early intervention services
- Physical therapy
- Occupational therapy
- Speech therapy
- Behavioral interventions
- Regular medical monitoring
- Surgical corrections for structural anomalies
- Nutritional support
- Psychological counseling

### Clinical Trials and Studies
- Ongoing research at major genetic research centers
- Clinical trials available at [clinicaltrials.gov]
- Focus on genetic mechanisms and potential therapeutic interventions
