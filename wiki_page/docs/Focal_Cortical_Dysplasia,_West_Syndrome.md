# Focal Cortical Dysplasia, West Syndrome

### Disease Overview
Focal Cortical Dysplasia (FCD) is a congenital neurological disorder characterized by abnormal brain cortex development, leading to treatment-resistant epilepsy. West Syndrome is a severe epilepsy syndrome affecting infants, marked by characteristic seizures, developmental regression, and distinctive brain wave patterns.

### Disease Category
- Focal Cortical Dysplasia: Neurological disorder, Developmental brain malformation, Epilepsy syndrome
- West Syndrome: Pediatric epileptic encephalopathy, Neurodevelopmental disorder

### Synonyms
- Focal Cortical Dysplasia: Cortical Dysplasia, Malformative Cortical Development
- West Syndrome: Infantile Spasms, Generalized Flexion Epilepsy, Hypsarrhythmia Syndrome

### Signs & Symptoms
**Focal Cortical Dysplasia**:
- Recurrent, medication-resistant seizures
- Focal neurological deficits
- Cognitive impairment
- Potential motor skill limitations
- Sensory processing difficulties

**West Syndrome**:
- Characteristic infantile spasms (sudden, brief muscle contractions)
- Developmental regression or stagnation
- Hypsarrhythmia on EEG (chaotic brain wave pattern)
- Potential intellectual disability
- Increased irritability
- Feeding difficulties

### Causes
**Focal Cortical Dysplasia**:
- Genetic mutations (MTOR, DEPDC5 genes)
- Prenatal neuronal migration disruptions
- Potential environmental factors during brain development
- Possible genetic mosaicism

**West Syndrome**:
- Genetic mutations
- Metabolic disorders
- Chromosomal abnormalities
- Brain malformations
- Perinatal brain injuries
- Tuberous Sclerosis Complex
- Infections affecting brain development

### Affected Populations
- Focal Cortical Dysplasia: 
  - Prevalence: 1-2 per 1,000 individuals
  - Most commonly diagnosed in children
  - No significant gender predilection

- West Syndrome:
  - Incidence: 1 in 2,000-4,000 live births
  - Typically onset between 3-12 months
  - Affects both genders equally

### Disorders with Similar Symptoms
- Tuberous Sclerosis
- Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome
- Polymicrogyria
- Early Infantile Epileptic Encephalopathy
- Sturge-Weber Syndrome

### Diagnosis
**Focal Cortical Dysplasia**:
- High-resolution MRI
- Electroencephalography (EEG)
- Genetic testing
- Neuropsychological assessment

**West Syndrome**:
- Clinical symptom evaluation
- Video EEG monitoring
- Brain imaging (MRI, CT)
- Genetic screening
- Metabolic disorder testing

### Standard Therapies
**Focal Cortical Dysplasia**:
- Surgical resection
- Anti-epileptic medications
- Vagus nerve stimulation
- Ketogenic diet
- Neurodevelopmental rehabilitation

**West Syndrome**:
- ACTH therapy
- Oral corticosteroids
- Vigabatrin
- Ketogenic diet
- Developmental interventions
- Physical and occupational therapy

### Clinical Trials and Studies
- Ongoing research at major epilepsy centers
- Genetic therapy investigations
- Novel anti-epileptic drug trials
- Neuroplasticity and rehabilitation studies
