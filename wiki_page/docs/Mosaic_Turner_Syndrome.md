# Mosaic Turner Syndrome

### Disease Overview
Mosaic Turner Syndrome is a rare chromosomal disorder affecting females, characterized by a mixture of cell lines with different chromosomal compositions, typically involving 45,X and 46,XX karyotypes. This genetic variation results in a less severe presentation compared to classical Turner Syndrome, with symptoms and severity varying widely between individuals.

### Disease Category
Genetic Disorder
- Chromosomal Abnormality
- Sex Chromosome Disorder

### Synonyms
- 45,X/46,XX Syndrome
- Mosaic Turner Syndrome
- Mixed Gonadal Dysgenesis
- Partial Turner Syndrome

### Signs & Symptoms
Physical Characteristics:
- Short stature
- Webbed neck
- Broad chest
- Widely spaced nipples
- Low posterior hairline
- Lymphedema of hands and feet

Reproductive Issues:
- Ovarian insufficiency

### Causes
Genetic Mechanism:
- Chromosomal nondisjunction during early embryonic cell division
- Random cell line mosaicism
- Partial or complete absence of one X chromosome in some cells
- Mixture of 45,X and 46,XX cell populations

### Affected Populations
- Exclusively affects females
- Incidence: Approximately 1 in 2,500 female live births
- Occurs randomly, with no specific ethnic or geographic predisposition
