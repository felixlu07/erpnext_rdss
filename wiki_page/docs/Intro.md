# Intro
The Rare Diseases Support Society (RDSS) repository provides comprehensive information about rare diseases, serving as a critical resource for patients, caregivers, healthcare professionals, and researchers.

### Disease Overview
This is a general repository for rare diseases, offering detailed insights into various uncommon medical conditions that affect small populations worldwide.

### Disease Category
Rare Diseases (Orphan Diseases)

### Synonyms
- Orphan Diseases
- Uncommon Medical Conditions
- Low-Prevalence Disorders

### Signs & Symptoms
Signs and symptoms vary widely depending on the specific rare disease, but may include:
- Unique genetic manifestations
- Complex medical presentations
- Challenging diagnostic criteria
- Potential multi-system involvement
- Potential developmental or progressive complications

### Causes
Rare diseases typically have complex origins, including:
- Genetic mutations
- Chromosomal abnormalities
- Congenital disorders
- Rare inherited conditions
- Spontaneous genetic variations

### Affected Populations
- Typically affects small patient groups (often defined as less than 200,000 individuals)
- Can impact all age groups
- May have higher prevalence in specific genetic or geographic populations

### Disorders with Similar Symptoms
- Genetic disorders
- Congenital conditions
- Autoimmune diseases
- Neurological disorders
- Metabolic disorders

### Diagnosis
Diagnostic approaches include:
