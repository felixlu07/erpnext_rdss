# Sturge Weber Syndrome

### Disease Overview
Sturge-Weber Syndrome (SWS) is a rare, congenital neurocutaneous disorder characterized by a distinctive facial port-wine birthmark and neurological abnormalities caused by abnormal blood vessel development in the brain and surrounding tissues. The condition is typically present at birth and can significantly impact neurological function and quality of life.

### Disease Category
Neurocutaneous Disorder
- Neurological Condition
- Vascular Malformation Syndrome

### Synonyms
- Encephalotrigeminal Angiomatosis
- Sturge-Weber Disease
- SWS

### Signs & Symptoms
Primary Clinical Manifestations:
- Facial port-wine stain (nevus flammeus), typically unilateral
- Neurological complications
- Seizures
- Developmental delays
- Glaucoma
- Chronic headaches
- Hemiparesis
- Intellectual disability
- Potential vision and hearing impairments
- Potential cognitive challenges

### Causes
Genetic Etiology:
- Somatic mutation in the GNAQ gene
- Occurs randomly during early embryonic development
- Not inherited
- Mutation affects blood vessel formation and neurological development

### Affected Populations
- Incidence: 1 in 20,000 to 1 in 50,000 newborns
- Equal gender distribution
- No specific ethnic predisposition
- Sporadic occurrence

### Disorders with Similar Symptoms
- Klippel-Trenaunay Syndrome
- Parkes Weber Syndrome
- Other facial vascular malformations
- Neurocutaneous syndromes
- Port-wine stain disorders

### Diagnosis
Diagnostic Approach:
- Comprehensive clinical evaluation
- Physical examination
- Detailed medical history
- Neurological assessment
- Imaging studies (MRI, CT scans)
- Ophthalmological examinations
- Genetic testing
- Electroencephalogram (EEG)

### Standard Therapies
Multidisciplinary Treatment:
- Anticonvulsant medications
- Pulsed dye laser treatment for port-wine stains
- Glaucoma management
- Surgical interventions
- Physical therapy
- Occupational therapy
- Educational support
- Psychological counseling

### Clinical Trials and Studies
Research Focus:
- Genetic mechanisms
- Novel therapeutic approaches
- Long-term outcome studies
- Treatment optimization
