# Pierre Robin Sequence

### Disease Overview
Pierre Robin Sequence (PRS) is a rare congenital condition characterized by a triad of craniofacial anomalies: micrognathia (small lower jaw), glossoptosis (backward displacement of the tongue), and airway obstruction. Often associated with a cleft palate, this condition can cause significant breathing and feeding challenges in newborns and infants.

### Disease Category
Craniofacial Developmental Disorder

### Synonyms
- Robin sequence
- Pierre Robin syndrome
- Robin anomaly
- Robin complex

### Signs & Symptoms
- Micrognathia (undersized lower jaw)
- Glossoptosis (backward tongue displacement)
- Potential cleft palate
- Airway obstruction
- Breathing difficulties
- Feeding challenges
- Increased risk of respiratory complications
- Potential speech and hearing difficulties
- Potential sleep apnea
- Potential dental misalignment

### Causes
- Genetic mutations
- Developmental disruptions during embryonic growth
- Potential chromosomal abnormalities
- Associated syndromes:
  - Stickler syndrome
  - 22q11.2 deletion syndrome
  - Treacher Collins syndrome
- Potential environmental factors during fetal development

### Affected Populations
- Incidence: 1 in 8,500 to 14,000 live births
- Equal prevalence in males and females
- Occurs across all ethnic populations
- Can be sporadic or inherited

### Disorders with Similar Symptoms
- Treacher Collins syndrome
- Stickler syndrome
- Velocardiofacial syndrome
- Nager syndrome
- Goldenhar syndrome
- Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome

### Diagnosis
- Prenatal ultrasound screening
- Physical examination at birth
- Imaging studies:
  - CT scan
  - MRI
- Genetic testing
- Comprehensive craniofacial assessment
- Sleep study to evaluate respiratory function

### Standard Therapies
- Immediate Airway Management
  - Prone positioning
  - Nasopharyngeal airway
  - Potential intubation
- Feeding Support
  - Specialized feeding techniques
  - Feeding tubes
  - Specialized bottles
- Surgical Interventions
  - Mandibular distraction osteogenesis
  - Cleft palate repair (typically 9-12 months)
- Multidisciplinary Care
  - Pediatric specialists
  - Craniofacial surgeons
  - Otolaryngologists
  - Speech therapists
  - Orthodontists

### Clinical Trials and Studies
- Ongoing research into genetic causes
- Surgical technique improvements
- Long-term developmental outcome studies
- Genetic screening and intervention studies
