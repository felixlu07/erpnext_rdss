# Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy

### Disease Overview
Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) is a severe, progressive genetic disorder characterized by rapid muscle degeneration and weakness. It is the most common and most severe form of muscular dystrophy in children, typically manifesting in early childhood and predominantly affecting males. The disease leads to progressive muscle loss, mobility challenges, and significant impact on life expectancy.

### Disease Category
- Genetic disorder
- Neuromuscular disorder
- X-linked recessive inherited disease
- Muscular dystrophy

### Synonyms
- DMD
- Muscular dystrophy, Duchenne type
- Pseudohypertrophic muscular dystrophy
- Duchenne-type muscular dystrophy

### Signs & Symptoms
- Progressive muscle weakness
- Muscle degeneration
- Enlarged, weak calf muscles (pseudohypertrophy)
- Delayed motor skill development
- Difficulty walking, running, and climbing stairs
- Frequent falls
- Gower's maneuver (using hands to rise from floor)
- Contractures and joint stiffness
- Respiratory insufficiency
- Cardiac complications
- Potential intellectual impairment
- Loss of independent walking (typically by age 12)

### Causes
- Mutations in the DMD gene on the X chromosome
- Absence or significant reduction of dystrophin protein
- Genetic inheritance pattern: X-linked recessive
- Spontaneous genetic mutations can occur
- Affects protein production critical for muscle cell membrane stability

### Affected Populations
- Occurs in approximately 1 in 3,500-5,000 male births
- Primarily affects males
- Females can be carriers
- Onset typically between ages 2-5 years
- Global occurrence across all ethnic groups

### Disorders with Similar Symptoms
- Becker Muscular Dystrophy
- Limb-Girdle Muscular Dystrophy
- Congenital Muscular Dystrophy
- Spinal Muscular Atrophy
- Myopathies
- Emery-Dreifuss Muscular Dystrophy

### Diagnosis
- Comprehensive medical history
- Physical examination
- Genetic testing
- Creatine kinase (CK) blood test
- Muscle biopsy
- Electromyography (EMG)
- Genetic counseling
- Molecular genetic testing
- Muscle imaging studies

### Standard Therapies
- Corticosteroid medications
- Physical therapy
- Occupational therapy
- Respiratory support
- Cardiac monitoring
- Orthopedic interventions
- Assistive mobility devices
- Nutritional support
- Psychological counseling

### Clinical Trials and Studies
- Gene therapy research
- Exon skipping techniques
- Stem cell therapies
- Dystrophin replacement strategies
- Molecular targeted therapies
- Ongoing research at major medical institutions
- Trials registered on ClinicalTrials.gov
