# May-Thurner Syndrome

### Disease Overview
May-Thurner Syndrome (MTS) is a rare vascular disorder characterized by compression of the left iliac vein by the right iliac artery against the lumbar spine. This anatomical compression can lead to reduced blood flow, potential vein wall damage, and increased risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) primarily in the left leg.

### Disease Category
Vascular Disorder / Venous Compression Syndrome

### Synonyms
- Iliac Vein Compression Syndrome
- Cockett Syndrome
- Left Iliac Vein Compression Syndrome

### Signs & Symptoms
- Swelling in the left leg
- Pain in the left leg, especially when standing
- Varicose veins in the affected leg
- Deep vein thrombosis (DVT)
- Venous ulcers (in advanced cases)
- Feeling of heaviness in the leg
- Leg discoloration
- Chronic leg pain
- Increased leg temperature

### Causes
- Anatomical variation where the right iliac artery compresses the left iliac vein
- Congenital vascular anatomy differences
- Potential genetic predisposition
- Prolonged periods of immobility
- Hormonal influences
- Increased risk with obesity
- Pregnancy and associated hormonal changes

### Affected Populations
- Predominantly affects individuals between 20-40 years old
- More common in women (approximately 3:1 female to male ratio)
- Higher risk in:
  - Individuals with sedentary lifestyles
  - Pregnant women
  - People with obesity
  - Those with prolonged immobility

### Disorders with Similar Symptoms
- Deep vein thrombosis (DVT)
- Chronic venous insufficiency
- Post-thrombotic syndrome
- Lymphedema
- Peripheral vascular disease
- Venous malformations

### Diagnosis
- Duplex ultrasound
- Venography
- Magnetic Resonance Venography (MRV)
- Computed Tomography (CT) scan
- Intravascular Ultrasound (IVUS)
- Contrast-enhanced imaging
- Venous hemodynamic studies

### Standard Therapies
- Conservative Management:
  - Compression stockings
  - Anticoagulant medications
  - Leg elevation
  - Regular exercise
  - Weight management

- Interventional Treatments:
  - Angioplasty
  - Stent placement
  - Venous bypass surgery
  - Thrombolysis

- Surgical Interventions:
  - Surgical decompression
  - Vein transposition
  - Iliac vein reconstruction

### Clinical Trials and Studies
- Ongoing research into minimally invasive treatment techniques
- Studies exploring genetic predisposition
- Investigations into long-term outcomes of various interventions
- Comparative studies of different treatment modalities

### Complete Report
May-Thurner Syndrome is a complex vascular condition requiring comprehensive medical evaluation and personalized treatment approaches. Early diagnosis and appropriate management can significantly improve patient outcomes and prevent potential complications like deep vein thrombosis.
