# Mucopolysaccharidosis type VI (MPS VI)

### Disease Overview
Mucopolysaccharidosis type VI (MPS VI) is a rare, progressive genetic disorder characterized by the body's inability to break down specific complex sugar molecules (glycosaminoglycans) due to a deficient enzyme. The condition leads to widespread cellular and organ damage, causing significant physical and developmental challenges.

### Disease Category
Lysosomal Storage Disorder (LSD)
Metabolic Disorder
Genetic Disorder

### Synonyms
- Maroteaux-Lamy Syndrome
- Arylsulfatase B Deficiency
- MPS 6
- Polydystrophic Dwarfism

### Signs & Symptoms
Progressive symptoms include:
Physical Characteristics:
- Short stature
- Coarse facial features
- Skeletal deformities
- Joint stiffness and contractures
- Enlarged liver and spleen

Organ System Complications:
- Cardiac valve abnormalities
- Respiratory difficulties
- Corneal clouding
- Hearing loss
- Recurrent ear infections
- Hernias
- Spinal cord compression

### Causes
Genetic Basis:
- Autosomal recessive inheritance
- Mutations in the ARSB gene
- Results in deficiency of arylsulfatase B enzyme
- Leads to accumulation of dermatan sulfate in cells and tissues

### Affected Populations
- Prevalence: 1 in 250,000 to 1 in 600,000 births
- Affects all ethnic groups equally
- No gender predilection
- Typically diagnosed in early childhood

### Disorders with Similar Symptoms
- Mucopolysaccharidosis type I (Hurler syndrome)
- Mucopolysaccharidosis type II (Hunter syndrome)
- Mucopolysaccharidosis type IV (Morquio syndrome)
- Other lysosomal storage disorders

### Diagnosis
Diagnostic Approach:
- Comprehensive clinical evaluation
- Urine glycosaminoglycan screening
- Enzyme activity assay
- Genetic mutation analysis
- Imaging studies (X-rays, MRI)
- Cardiac and respiratory function tests

### Standard Therapies
Primary Treatments:
- Enzyme Replacement Therapy (ERT) with galsulfase
- Symptomatic management
- Physical and occupational therapy
- Orthopedic interventions
- Respiratory support
- Cardiac monitoring

### Clinical Trials and Studies
Research Focus Areas:
- Gene therapy
- Enhanced enzyme replacement strategies
- Small molecule therapies
- Long-term treatment outcomes
