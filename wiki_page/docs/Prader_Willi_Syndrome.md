# Prader Willi Syndrome

### Disease Overview
Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a rare and complex genetic disorder characterized by intellectual disabilities, behavioral problems, and distinctive physical features. The condition is primarily known for causing an uncontrollable appetite that can lead to severe obesity if not carefully managed.

### Disease Category
Genetic and Developmental Disorder
Chromosomal Condition
Rare Genetic Syndrome

### Synonyms
- PWS
- Prader-Labhart-Willi syndrome
- Prader-Willi-Fanconi syndrome

### Signs & Symptoms
**Neonatal Phase:**
- Severe hypotonia (low muscle tone)
- Feeding difficulties
- Weak cry
- Poor sucking reflex

**Infancy and Childhood:**
- Developmental delays
- Cognitive impairments
- Characteristic facial features
- Short stature
- Small hands and feet
- Delayed puberty

**Adolescence and Adulthood:**
- Hyperphagia (excessive hunger)
- Morbid obesity
- Intellectual disability
- Behavioral challenges
- Emotional instability
- Skin picking
- Sleep disturbances

### Causes
Genetic mutations affecting chromosome 15q11-q13, specifically:
- Paternal chromosome deletion (70% of cases)
- Maternal uniparental disomy (25% of cases)
- Imprinting center defects (5% of cases)

### Affected Populations
- Incidence: 1 in 10,000-30,000 live births
- Affects all ethnic groups
- Equal gender distribution
- No known geographic predisposition

### Disorders with Similar Symptoms
- Bardet-Biedl syndrome
- Alstr√∂m syndrome
- Cohen syndrome
- WAGR syndrome
- Fragile X syndrome

### Diagnosis
- Comprehensive clinical evaluation
- Genetic testing
  - DNA methylation analysis
  - Chromosomal microarray
  - Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)
- Molecular genetic testing
- Endocrine and metabolic assessments

### Standard Therapies
- Growth hormone therapy
- Nutritional counseling
- Behavioral interventions
- Physical therapy
- Occupational therapy
- Psychological support
- Hormone replacement therapy
- Strict dietary management

### Clinical Trials and Studies
Active research areas:
- Genetic therapies
- Appetite regulation
- Metabolic interventions
- Behavioral modification techniques

### Complete Report
Prader-Willi syndrome is a complex genetic disorder requiring multidisciplinary management. While no cure exists, early intervention, comprehensive care, and ongoing support can significantly improve patient outcomes and quality of life.
