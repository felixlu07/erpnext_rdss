# Emery-Dreifuss Muscular Dystrophy Type 2

### Disease Overview
Emery-Dreifuss Muscular Dystrophy Type 2 (EDMD2) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by progressive muscle weakness, joint contractures, and cardiac complications. The condition typically manifests in childhood or early adulthood, affecting muscle and heart function through mutations in the LMNA gene.

### Disease Category
Neuromuscular Disorders
Subtype: Muscular Dystrophy
Inheritance Pattern: Autosomal Dominant

### Synonyms
- AD-EDMD
- Autosomal Dominant Emery-Dreifuss Muscular Dystrophy
- LMNA-Related Muscular Dystrophy

### Signs & Symptoms
Primary symptoms include:
- Progressive muscle weakness (shoulders, upper arms, lower legs)
- Early-onset joint contractures (elbows, ankles, neck)
- Cardiac conduction defects
- Muscle atrophy
- Reduced mobility
- Potential respiratory complications
- Fatigue
- Potential cardiac arrhythmias

### Causes
- Genetic mutations in the LMNA gene
- Affects nuclear envelope protein production
- Autosomal dominant inheritance pattern
- Single mutated gene copy can cause disorder
- Disrupts nuclear membrane structural integrity

### Affected Populations
- Prevalence: Rare (estimated 1-5 per 100,000 individuals)
- Age of Onset: Childhood to early adulthood (typically 5-15 years)
- Gender Distribution: Equal affect across males and females
- Worldwide occurrence without significant ethnic predisposition

### Disorders with Similar Symptoms
- Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy
- Becker Muscular Dystrophy
- Limb-Girdle Muscular Dystrophy
- Congenital Muscular Dystrophy
- X-linked Emery-Dreifuss Muscular Dystrophy

### Diagnosis
Diagnostic Approach:
- Comprehensive clinical evaluation
- Detailed family medical history
- Genetic testing for LMNA mutations
- Electromyography (EMG)
- Muscle biopsy
- Cardiac screening (ECG, echocardiogram)
- Genetic counseling

### Standard Therapies
Management Strategies:
- Multidisciplinary care approach
- Physical therapy
- Orthopedic interventions
- Cardiac monitoring
- Assistive devices
- Potential cardiac medications
- Genetic counseling
- Symptomatic treatment

### Clinical Trials and Studies
- Ongoing research at major medical centers
- Potential gene therapy investigations
- Clinical trial information available at ClinicalTrials.gov
- Emerging therapeutic approaches under investigation
