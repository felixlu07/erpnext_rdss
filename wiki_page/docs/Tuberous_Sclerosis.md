# Tuberous Sclerosis

### Disease Overview
Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by the growth of benign tumors in multiple organ systems, including the brain, skin, kidneys, heart, eyes, and lungs. The condition is typically lifelong and can vary significantly in severity between individuals, ranging from mild symptoms to more complex medical challenges.

### Disease Category
Genetic Neurocutaneous Disorder
- Autosomal Dominant Inheritance
- Multisystem Developmental Disorder

### Synonyms
- Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC)
- Bourneville Disease
- Bourneville-Pringle Disease

### Signs & Symptoms
Neurological:
- Seizures
- Developmental delays
- Intellectual disability
- Autism spectrum disorder
- Cortical tubers
- Subependymal nodules

Dermatological:
- Hypomelanotic macules
- Facial angiofibromas
- Shagreen patches
- Ungual fibromas

Systemic:
- Kidney angiomyolipomas
- Cardiac rhabdomyomas
- Pulmonary lymphangioleiomyomatosis
- Retinal hamartomas
- Dental enamel pits

### Causes
Genetic Mutations:
- TSC1 gene mutations (chromosome 9)
- TSC2 gene mutations (chromosome 16)
- Mutations affect proteins hamartin and tuberin
- Disrupts cell growth regulation and mTOR pathway
- Can be inherited or occur as spontaneous mutations

### Affected Populations
- Incidence: 1 in 6,000-10,000 live births
- Affects all ethnic groups and genders equally
- No significant gender or racial predisposition
- Can occur in any family background

### Disorders with Similar Symptoms
- Neurofibromatosis
- Sturge-Weber syndrome
- Von Hippel-Lindau disease
- PTEN hamartoma syndrome

### Diagnosis
Diagnostic Criteria:
- Comprehensive clinical evaluation
- Genetic testing for TSC1/TSC2 mutations
- Neuroimaging (MRI, CT scans)
- Echocardiograms
- Renal ultrasounds
- Dermatological assessment
- Ophthalmological examination

### Standard Therapies
Multidisciplinary Management:
- Antiepileptic medications
- mTOR inhibitors (everolimus)
- Behavioral therapy
- Educational interventions
- Surgical tumor removal
- Symptomatic treatment
- Regular monitoring

### Clinical Trials and Studies
Research Focus Areas:
- Genetic therapies
- mTOR pathway interventions
- Tumor management strategies
- Neurological symptom control

Resources:
- ClinicalTrials.gov
- NIH Clinical Trials Database
