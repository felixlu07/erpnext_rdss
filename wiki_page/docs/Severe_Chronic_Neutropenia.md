# Severe Chronic Neutropenia

### Disease Overview
Severe Chronic Neutropenia (SCN) is a rare hematologic disorder characterized by persistently low levels of neutrophils, a critical type of white blood cell essential for fighting infections. The condition can be congenital or acquired, and significantly impacts the patient's immune system and overall health.

### Disease Category
Hematologic (Blood) Disorder
Immunodeficiency Disorder

### Synonyms
- Severe Congenital Neutropenia
- Kostmann Syndrome
- Idiopathic Neutropenia
- Congenital Neutropenia

### Signs & Symptoms
- Recurrent and severe infections
- Frequent fevers
- Mouth sores
- Periodontal disease
- Skin infections
- Ear infections
- Delayed wound healing
- Potential increased risk of developing leukemia
- Lymph node inflammation
- Fatigue
- Potential developmental delays (in congenital cases)

### Causes
Genetic Causes:
- Mutations in ELANE gene
- HAX1 gene mutations
- G6PC3 gene variations
- JAGN1 gene mutations
- Autosomal dominant or recessive inheritance patterns

Non-Genetic Causes:
- Autoimmune disorders
- Certain medications
- Viral infections
- Bone marrow disorders
- Idiopathic (unknown) causes

### Affected Populations
- Prevalence: Extremely rare (estimated 1 in 200,000 individuals)
- Age of Onset: 
  - Congenital form: Infancy or early childhood
  - Acquired form: Can occur at any age
- Gender Distribution: No significant gender predilection

### Disorders with Similar Symptoms
- Cyclic Neutropenia
- Myelodysplastic Syndromes
- Leukemia
- Aplastic Anemia
- Primary Immunodeficiency Disorders

### Diagnosis
Diagnostic Criteria:
- Complete Blood Count (CBC)
- Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) < 500 cells/Î¼L
- Bone marrow biopsy
- Genetic testing
- Immunological assessments
- Infection history evaluation

### Standard Therapies
- Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) injections
- Prophylactic antibiotics
- Antifungal medications
- Infection management
- Bone marrow or stem cell transplantation (in severe cases)
- Regular medical monitoring

### Clinical Trials and Studies
- Ongoing genetic research
- Novel treatment development
- Long-term outcome studies
- Immunotherapy investigations
- Stem cell therapy research
