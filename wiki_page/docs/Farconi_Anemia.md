# Fanconi Anemia

### Disease Overview
Fanconi Anemia (FA) is a rare, inherited genetic disorder characterized by bone marrow failure, congenital physical abnormalities, and a significantly increased risk of developing cancer. It is a complex genetic condition that affects multiple body systems and can have varying degrees of severity among affected individuals.

### Disease Category
- Rare Genetic Disorder
- Inherited Bone Marrow Failure Syndrome
- Chromosomal Instability Syndrome

### Synonyms
- FA
- Fanconi Pancytopenia
- Fanconi Anemia Syndrome

### Signs & Symptoms
Physical manifestations include:
- Congenital abnormalities
  - Short stature
  - Skeletal malformations
  - Kidney anomalies
  - Skin pigmentation changes
  - Cardiac defects
  - Reproductive system abnormalities

Hematological symptoms:
- Bone marrow failure
- Anemia
- Thrombocytopenia
- Leukopenia
- Increased risk of blood cancers

Additional complications:
- Higher susceptibility to solid tumors
- Developmental delays
- Endocrine disorders

### Causes
Genetic Factors:
- Mutations in DNA repair genes (at least 22 identified genes)
- Primary genes include FANCA, FANCC, FANCG
- Autosomal recessive inheritance pattern
- Requires mutation in both parental gene copies

### Affected Populations
- Worldwide distribution
- Prevalence: Approximately 1 in 160,000 live births
- Equal gender distribution
- Higher incidence in:
  - Ashkenazi Jewish populations
  - Afrikaners in South Africa

### Disorders with Similar Symptoms
- Dyskeratosis Congenita
- Shwachman-Diamond Syndrome
- Diamond-Blackfan Anemia
- Seckel Syndrome
- Bloom Syndrome

### Diagnosis
Diagnostic Methods:
- Comprehensive clinical evaluation
- Detailed family history
- Chromosome breakage tests
- Genetic mutation analysis
- Bone marrow biopsy
- Molecular genetic testing
- Prenatal genetic screening

### Standard Therapies
Treatment Approaches:
- Blood transfusions
- Androgen therapy
- Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation
- Cancer screening and management
- Surgical interventions for congenital abnormalities
- Genetic counseling
- Supportive care

### Clinical Trials and Studies
Current Research Focus:
- Gene therapy
- Advanced stem cell treatments
- Cancer prevention strategies
- Long-term outcome studies
- Molecular mechanism investigations
