# CDG PIGN

### Disease Overview
CDG PIGN (Congenital Disorder of Glycosylation PIGN) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by impaired glycosylation, a critical cellular process of attaching sugar molecules to proteins and lipids. The disorder results from mutations in the PIGN gene, leading to disruptions in glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor biosynthesis, which can significantly impact multiple organ systems and developmental processes.

### Disease Category
Rare Genetic Disorder
Subtype: Congenital Disorders of Glycosylation (CDGs)
Metabolic Disorder
Inherited Genetic Condition

### Synonyms
- PIGN-CDG
- Glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor deficiency
- PIGN-related Congenital Disorder of Glycosylation

### Signs & Symptoms
Neurological:
- Developmental delay
- Intellectual disability
- Seizures
- Hypotonia (low muscle tone)

Physical Characteristics:
- Facial dysmorphism
- Skeletal abnormalities
- Growth retardation
- Microcephaly

Systemic:
- Feeding difficulties
- Potential immune system complications
- Potential cardiac anomalies
- Potential vision and hearing impairments

### Causes
Genetic Mechanism:
- Autosomal recessive inheritance
- Mutations in the PIGN gene
- Disruption of GPI anchor biosynthesis pathway
- Impaired protein attachment to cell membranes

### Affected Populations
- Extremely rare disorder
- Estimated prevalence: Less than 1 in 1,000,000 individuals
- No significant gender or ethnic predisposition
- Typically identified in infancy or early childhood
