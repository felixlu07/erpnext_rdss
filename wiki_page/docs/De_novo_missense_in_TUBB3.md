# De novo missense in TUBB3

### Disease Overview
De novo missense mutations in the TUBB3 gene are rare genetic disorders characterized by spontaneous mutations affecting neuronal development and function. These mutations disrupt the formation and function of microtubules in neurons, leading to a spectrum of neurological and developmental abnormalities.

### Disease Category
- Genetic Disorder
- Neurological Disorder
- Neurodevelopmental Disorder

### Synonyms
- TUBB3-Related Neurogenetic Disorder
- TUBB3 Gene Mutation Syndrome
- Neuronal Tubulin Dysfunction Syndrome

### Signs & Symptoms
Neurological and developmental manifestations include:
- Congenital fibrosis of extraocular muscles (CFEOM)
- Developmental delays
- Intellectual disability
- Peripheral neuropathy
- Cortical dysplasia
- Microcephaly
- Hypotonia
- Impaired motor coordination
- Axonal guidance defects
- Potential visual impairments
- Potential speech and language delays
- Potential seizure disorders

### Causes
- Spontaneous (de novo) missense mutations in the TUBB3 gene
- Disruption of beta-tubulin protein structure and function
- Impaired microtubule dynamics in neuronal cells
- Interference with neuronal migration and development

### Affected Populations
- Rare disorder affecting all genders
- No specific racial or ethnic predisposition
- Typically identified in early childhood
- Estimated prevalence: Less than 1 in 100,000 individuals

### Disorders with Similar Symptoms
- Congenital fibrosis of extraocular muscles (alternative genetic causes)
- Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease
- Hereditary spastic paraplegia
- Cortical malformation syndromes
- Neurodevelopmental disorders with motor impairments

### Diagnosis
Diagnostic approach:
- Comprehensive neurological examination
- Detailed medical history
- Genetic testing for TUBB3 mutations
- Neuroimaging (MRI, CT scan)
- Electromyography (EMG)
- Nerve conduction studies
- Ophthalmological assessments
- Developmental screening

### Standard Therapies
Multidisciplinary management:
- Individualized physical therapy
- Occupational therapy
- Speech and language therapy
- Special education support
- Orthopedic interventions
- Potential surgical corrections for eye muscle abnormalities
- Symptomatic treatment of neurological complications

### Clinical Trials and Studies
- Ongoing research in genetic therapies
- Studies exploring microtubule stabilization
- Investigations into potential molecular interventions
- Recommended resource: ClinicalTrials.gov
