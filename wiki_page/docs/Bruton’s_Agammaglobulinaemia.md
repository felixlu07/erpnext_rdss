# Bruton's Agammaglobulinaemia

### Disease Overview
Bruton's Agammaglobulinaemia is a rare primary immunodeficiency disorder characterized by the absence or severe reduction of B lymphocytes and immunoglobulins, resulting in a profound impairment of the immune system's ability to fight infections.

### Disease Category
Primary Immunodeficiency Disorder (Humoral Immunodeficiency)

### Synonyms
- X-linked Agammaglobulinaemia (XLA)
- Congenital Agammaglobulinaemia
- Bruton's Hypogammaglobulinemia
- Sex-linked Agammaglobulinaemia

### Signs & Symptoms
- Recurrent bacterial infections
- Increased susceptibility to respiratory tract infections
- Chronic sinusitis
- Repeated ear infections
- Pneumonia
- Gastrointestinal infections
- Skin infections
- Arthritis
- Delayed growth and development
- Absence of tonsils and lymph node enlargement
- Increased risk of autoimmune disorders
- Potential development of chronic lung disease

### Causes
- Genetic mutation in the BTK (Bruton Tyrosine Kinase) gene
- X-linked recessive inheritance pattern
- Mutation prevents B cell maturation and antibody production
- Primarily affects males due to X-linked transmission

### Affected Populations
- Predominantly males
- Incidence: Approximately 1 in 190,000 live births
- Typically diagnosed between 6 months and 5 years of age
- Occurs across all ethnic groups

### Disorders with Similar Symptoms
- Common Variable Immunodeficiency (CVID)
- Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (SCID)
- Hyper IgM Syndrome
- Selective IgA Deficiency
- Chronic Granulomatous Disease

### Diagnosis
- Comprehensive medical history
- Physical examination
- Blood tests measuring immunoglobulin levels
- Flow cytometry to assess B cell count
- Genetic testing for BTK gene mutations
- Immunological function tests
- Family history analysis

### Standard Therapies
- Lifelong immunoglobulin replacement therapy
- Intravenous or subcutaneous immunoglobulin (IVIG/SCIG)
- Prophylactic antibiotics
- Regular medical monitoring
- Vaccination with inactivated vaccines
- Treatment of acute infections
- Potential gene therapy (experimental)

### Clinical Trials and Studies
- Ongoing research in gene therapy
- Investigations into novel immunoglobulin replacement strategies
- Studies exploring long-term management techniques
- Genetic modification approaches
- Recommended resource: ClinicalTrials.gov
