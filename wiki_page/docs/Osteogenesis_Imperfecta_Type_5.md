# Osteogenesis Imperfecta Type 5

### Disease Overview
Osteogenesis Imperfecta (OI) Type 5 is a rare genetic disorder characterized by moderate to severe bone fragility, distinctive clinical features, and unique radiographic findings. This specific type of OI is distinguished by its characteristic hyperplastic callus formation following fractures and specific genetic mutations.

### Disease Category
Genetic bone disorder
Subtype of Osteogenesis Imperfecta (Brittle Bone Disease)
Inherited connective tissue disorder

### Synonyms
- OI Type V
- Osteogenesis Imperfecta V

### Signs & Symptoms
- Frequent bone fractures
- Hyperplastic callus formation during bone healing
- Calcification of interosseous membrane (especially in forearms)
- Normal-colored sclerae
- Variable bone density (osteopenia)
- Potential progressive bone deformities
- Reduced bone strength
- Potential joint laxity
- Minimal dental complications compared to other OI types

### Causes
- Genetic mutation in the IFITM5 gene
- Autosomal dominant inheritance pattern
- Mutation leads to abnormal protein production affecting bone formation and quality
- Disrupts normal bone mineralization and structural integrity

### Affected Populations
- Prevalence: Rare
- Incidence: Part of overall OI population (1 in 15,000-20,000 live births)
- Affects both males and females equally
- Can occur in all ethnic groups
- Typically diagnosed in childhood or early adolescence

### Disorders with Similar Symptoms
- Other Osteogenesis Imperfecta types (1-4, 6-8)
- Hypophosphatasia
- Type I Collagen disorders
- Secondary osteoporosis
- Metabolic bone diseases

### Diagnosis
- Comprehensive clinical evaluation
- Detailed medical history
- Genetic testing for IFITM5 mutation
- Radiographic imaging
- Bone density scans
- Molecular genetic testing
- Potential skin or bone biopsy

### Standard Therapies
- Pharmacological Interventions:
  - Bisphosphonates
  - Pain management medications
  - Calcium and vitamin D supplements

- Surgical Interventions:
  - Intramedullary rodding
  - Fracture repair
  - Orthopedic corrections

- Supportive Therapies:
  - Physical therapy
  - Occupational therapy
  - Mobility assistance devices
  - Rehabilitation programs

### Clinical Trials and Studies
- Ongoing research in gene therapy
- Studies exploring novel treatment approaches
- Investigations into targeted molecular interventions
- Recommended resource: ClinicalTrials.gov for current studies
